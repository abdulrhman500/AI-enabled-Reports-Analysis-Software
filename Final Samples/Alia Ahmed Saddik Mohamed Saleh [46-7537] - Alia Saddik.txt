Tasks:              The tasks we worked on during this internship varied from courses, projects, research, and presentations. We took various courses and many presentations about the company functions and software used were presented by the engineers. Golang, Flask, Docker, Django, and GitHub actions resources were provided by the supervisor for us to study. Also, presentations about the whole  ThreeFold  (their current customer) eco-system, how it works, and how a user can use in addition to all the technologies that are included in the whole development cycle of the project were provided by the engineers who worked on it. The projects we worked on included a simple Golang INI file parser with its unit tests and GitHub actions that ran them. Also, a full stack to-do web app that was later containerized using docker. This web app was built using Golang and mongo DB for the backend and svelte and typescript for the front end. The backend was tested using the Golang unit tests, and postman and open-API (swagger API) was built to ensure the robustness of the backend. Cypress was used to test the front end.  The GitHub actions for this project automated the build and updated the image for the docker container and ran all the tests. Another mini project was a telegram bot that was built using python, this project was containerized using the threefold ecosystem. Finally, we worked on a new HR system web app for Codescalers-Egypt employees. For the backend, I worked on authentication and authorization using JWT and Django.  I also worked on all the user profile operations for all types of users (admins, supervisors and employees). For the front end, I used svelte and typescript to incorporate authentication and authorization in the front end. In addition to building the login and registration pages. Regarding the research, research was held about IPFS planning services to discuss it with the decision makers for Codescalers to start using it in their current project. Finally, a presentation was prepared and held for my colleagues, supervisor and the project manager about web3.  Internship
