Tasks:The internship program at TUD starts with a period to get familiar with the topic and the domain which is ITsecurity, which was done by reading from resources provided by my supervisor and other research conducted bymyself. After that, I was required to understand our targeted system clearly to come out with a set ofrequirements that would fit this system. Then, upon presenting these requirements and taking the approval of therest of the team, I started to work on how to come out with a system design that would satisfy theserequirements. Finally, I implemented a mockup system to show how the actual system should work.Internship
