The performed tasks during the internship at Valeo as a software engineer intern in the THS (Thermal and Heat System) department included:

1. Working on a project related to a sensor for control and diagnostics of emission systems utilizing diesel particulate filters (DPF) called PM sensor. The task was to add a new feature to ensure the calculation of multiple sensors instead of one and display it in a desktop application.

2. Communicating with the sensor using the LIN (Local Interconnect Network) protocol and using the BabyLIN library for communication with the sensor chip.

3. Implementing a new tool in the HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) project that involved calculating new values added to the HVAC system in an external application.

4. Designing a system and implementing system requirements based on client descriptions.

5. Implementing projects using the V cycle methodology to meet deadlines and troubleshoot issues.

6. Gaining knowledge about embedded systems and their protocols.

7. Learning additional material on top of what was learned in the GUC (MET) related to Object-Oriented Programming (CSEN401), Digital System Design (DSD), and Digital Logic Design (DLD).

Overall, the internship provided exposure to corporate project management, embedded systems, and various technologies. It enhanced the skills of system design, implementation, and communication.
