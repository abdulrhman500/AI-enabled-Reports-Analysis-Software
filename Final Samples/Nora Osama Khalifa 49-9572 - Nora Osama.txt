Tasks:   I performed several tasks in this internship. On a daily basis, I would collect audios from a TV series using Audacity. I would name each file according to the actor id and emotion that I felt in their tone. I had 6 emotion categories which were fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised. Later I would upload the audios to google drive which was shared with my teammates and in an excel sheet we would all write our audio file name along with other parameters. After I am done uploading my audios, I would listen to my teammate's audios so I could categorize their audios according to the 6 emotions. I later on added my categorization to the excel sheet. At the end of the day each audio would get four labels, one label from each teammate. This was done to get accurate and precise results. I later on did a python coding task to read the excel sheet which was in csv format and get the label that was done the most for each audio. This code created a new csv file which renamed the audio file 1  Student Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt          and wrote the final label in another column. I also did a task which removed silence and background noise from the audio files using python code so when they're fed to the AI it won't affect the results. At the end of the internship I collected a total of 500 audios.    Internship
