Tasks: Initially, I had to read some papers to have enough knowledge to be able to help in building the Egyptian chatbot and then I started learning Linux, downloading Visual Studio Code, setting up a virtual environment, installing and learning about Rasa framework (the chatbot library), setting up GitHub SSH and cloning the existing code. After that, I needed to collect some online data, such as the names of all Egyptian cities and crops with the correct Arabic spelling and then writing a python script that produces other versions of these data with common spelling mistakes, so that the bot could recognize and classify them correctly. Moreover, I had to design and create a simple webchat (see fig.1) that takes a text input from user, or alternatively the user can record a voice note instead which would be processed into text, and then send an API request to the bot to get the appropriate response. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the webchat and a JavaScript library (recoder.js) for the recording feature. Also, I had to make a decision tree on Rasa where I wrote a python script for each question so that the bot could extract the answer from the text and for every answer a unique series of questions will be asked and then based on all the answers, the plant’s diagnosis will be figured and there will be suggestions on how to fix it. Finally, I had to predict different ways the user can ask for something and then talk with the chatbot to test all possible paths to make sure it’s working as predicted.  Internship
