 The main goal of the internship was to provide a dataset that will help research in the emotion recognition from speech for Egyptian Arabic. I have managed and organized teams that worked on the data extraction and analysis tasks. Also, I have created a website alongside my colleagues using the MERN stack on Visual Studio Code. The website contains the information in the extracted dataset. I have also performed data augmentation tasks on the audios in the dataset to produce more samples on Google Colab using Python libraries. This task was performed to help produce better performance for deep learning tasks.
