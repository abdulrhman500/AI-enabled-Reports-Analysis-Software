 In this internship, 1 have learnt how to use the MEAN stack to develop both an HR tool for employee vacations within a given company as well as a student management system web application for all student and admin purposes such as adding a new student to the system by an admin, deleting a student, editing a student’s information or viewing the list of all existing students. | have used Angular for all the front end development and NEST JS for all backend development. Mongo DB was also used locally as a database to store all existing students and admins. My first task was to use angular for all CRUD operations regarding the student, with no backend development or database. My second task was to then add REST API’s to my angular web to perform the given CRUD operations. The next task was to implement NEST JS using Typescript, which I also learnt during my period at Schneider Electric, for the backend portion, in addition to my angular web and REST API’s. Then, I added Mongo DB to my web application and developed a full-stack student management system. My final task was to implement a vacation management system for employees and their managers using all the different languages and tools I learnt throughout the internship. I had to implement the employee’s request for vacations, as well as the managers’ acceptance depending on factors such as the type of vacation, remaining days for that particular employee, and whether they are eligible for vacation at that time of year.
