Tasks:  During this internship my tasks mostly required me to write code in java, which is an object oriented programming language, so basically I was a java developer .Most of the tasks I performed was related to software development mostly in the non-banking services that the company offers such as implementing new features to already existing applications or update features that already exists but are currently causing issues for the users. Non-banking services are services that the banks still need but donâ€™t fall under the umbrella of financial services. An example of Non-banking services is the HR management systems of banks, call control and time attendance. Most of the tasks I performed were related to those services along with same databases manipulation (MySQL) if needed for the tasks. Java is the programming language that we used in most of the courses here at the university so this give me a head start in the internship and give me enough time to focus on having a profound understanding of the assigned tasks. I worked with a team were each member had a specific task to perform under the supervision of a senior developer, who coordinate between the different tasks and assign each part to a developer and to which we report back when we end the assigned task or face a certain problem. At first my skills was tested with small tasks then later more important tasks were assigned to me. I think this internship give me valuable expertise in the general flow of tasks in a working environment.  Internship
