activities Our internship supervisors were: Assoc. Prof. Dr. Amir Roushdy Ali, Dr. Taher Mohamed Salah El-Din, and Dr. Hesham Elsherif. The internship days are classified into 3 main types: lecture day, practical day, and task day. These 3 days were repeated during the internship.  In the lecture day, we have a session with our supervisor Dr. Taher Mohamed Salah El-Din, in this session we learn more about new topics about hydraulics or Electrohydraulics. The main topics were:  - Fundamentals of hydraulics - Hydraulic circuit components and their types, for example: pumps, valves and the used symbols - Simulation of hydraulic circuit using fluidSIM and Automation studio  - Modeling of hydraulic circuits and how to control it In the practical day: we implemented hydraulic circuits in the hydraulic lab and the pneumatics lab and the beginning, until we know the basics then we were ready to implement circuits in the IHA (International Hydraulics Academy) in the GUC campus lab. We used to work with hydraulics but in the pneumatics lab we had the chance to work with Electrohydraulics. In the task day: we worked with 3 clever students that had just finished their bachelor, they are: Mariam Tarek, Mohamed Hussein, and Nabil Khaled. They implemented a hydraulic circuit to power “Hydraulic test-rig” machine. At the beginning they used to explain main parts of their project then giving extra tasks on what we had already learnt. We started working for the tasks using Solid Works and Lab view. In addition, we learnt about how to control the system.
