During the internship, the individual:
- contributed to the construction of a dataset for an algorithm to recognize different emotions from speech clips in Egyptian Arabic.
- recorded audio clips from Egyptian Arabic media, such as TV shows and movies, depicting certain emotions.
- labeled the recordings with agreed-upon naming conventions, including the actor/actress's name, intended emotion, and a number to keep track of all the clips.
- uploaded the clips to a Google Drive accessible to all participants.
- reviewed colleagues' clips and provided their own label to reduce errors and disagreement about the depicted emotion.
- coded a program to access a Google sheet and determine the majority emotion label for each entry.
- coded a program to remove silence and reduce background noise from audio clips.
- used various libraries and tools, including Audacity, audacity, Visual Studio code, Python, csv, pandas, scipy.io, wavfile, noisereduce, math, logging, numpy, librosa, and soundfile.
- acquired valuable skills in teamwork, coordination, and technical abilities.
- gained an insight into the field of machine learning.
- related the internship activities to their studies in coding, algorithms, and audacity.
- expressed recommendation for this internship as an excellent entry point to machine learning.
