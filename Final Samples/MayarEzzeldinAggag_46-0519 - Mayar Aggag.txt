TasksAs a data analyst (customer experience) intern, the company provides us with laptops.Then, I was assigned a task to work on during the month of August. The task assigned by mymentor “May Okba” was full stack development of a web page using Node Js, SQL, andAngular, that shows the user feedback in the form of graphs. The SQL databases created by theneighboring teams included: IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identifier), MSISDN(Mobile Station Integrated Services Digital Network), Call drop rates, etc.. The frontendconsisted of 2 search bars one for the IMSI and the other for MSISDN to find each user’s info.Following that, graphs or trends appear to show rates of several conditions the users getencountered with, like call drops, the device has no signal (in this case the device details aredisplayed), or  data service drops. Using specific calculations, a feedback alert will get displayedshowing the state of each customer based on the trends shown. This web page is created for otherteams to easily visualize problems faced by customers and try to trace where the technical issuesarose from. This is important for the loyalty of customers and to avoid unsatisfiable service.PS. THE DATA USED AND WEB PAGE (CODE SNIPPETS) CREATED IS HIGHLYCONFIDENTIALA typical example of a working day as a full stack developer intern at Vodafone consistsof arriving at work at 9 am. I start by giving a brief to my mentor and teammates of the workdone and work left to do. Then I proceed by continuing the task and communicating with the restof the team during the day to keep up with each other. Then I check the outlook mail for onlinecourses provided for all the employees to improve our knowledge and skills in various topics.Following that,  HR organizes daily events for all the interns to attend and socialize such as“Chat with the CEO”,  “CV Writing and Interview Tips”,  and “Mental Wellbeing Sessions”.There was also a field trip for all the VodaNation members which was a Cycling and joggingevent at Cairo University. Moreover,  HR organizes events such as “Bring your kids to work” forthe employees and allow the interns to volunteer in them and provide certificates for that at theend.Internship
