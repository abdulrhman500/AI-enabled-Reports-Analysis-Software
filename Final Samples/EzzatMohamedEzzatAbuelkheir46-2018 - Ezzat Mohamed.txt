tasks As an intern I was first asked to do some research about soma data tools and do a presentation. For the first week I started doing research about data warehouses  where I was introduced to postgresql ,presto and kafka which  are data data warehouses used to store data. Then I was asked to do a research about data analytical tool where I was introduced to Tableau which is a tool used to analyse data and help in observing how it acts. After getting much knowledge about data tools and each one benefits we started creating our data pipeline architecture that we designed and was supposed by me. The whole team started setting up the tools on our laptops and it took us a while since many tools needed more specs and different operating systems. Finally we worked on extracting the data from Alex bank rest apiâ€™s to start analysing and providing them with the dashboards they needed however the since it is a bank data it was very credential and that was a very challenging task. We used python to extract data from the rest api and send it to our data warehouse which according to our architecture was Kafka   then after storing the data we needed we start analysing. Internship
