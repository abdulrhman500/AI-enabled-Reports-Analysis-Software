] worked on a project manager desktop application where a user can create jobs and employees that can be used to create a task which can take in a list of jobs and employees. A project can be created using a list of tasks. A user can create, edit, and delete a user, a task, a job, or a project so that every project can be monitored and analyzed to improve performance. The application was made using java. The interface was made using Scene Builder that uses javafx. The database used was SQLite.  Another task I handled was editing a large collection of word and excel documents changing old date in the header and footer of each document including changing the logo and the date to the most recent date of any change applied on the document.
