 Throughout this internship we designed a haptic glove that was used to give a real feeling of the vibrations experienced when driving a car. Small actuators called "mini vibrators‚Äù were attached to the gloves and connected to arduino, an accelerometer was used to measure viberations and send a signal to the gloves so that the actuators vibrate according to the given signal. After finishing the gloves it was required to integrate them with the VR system and working on the signal to be sent in real time through a cloud called firebase. The final step was taking the viberation values and mapping them to have a realistic feeling of the vibrations.
