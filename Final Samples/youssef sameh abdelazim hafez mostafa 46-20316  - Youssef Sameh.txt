Tasks: (Not less than 100 words)My main objective in the bachelor and internship was to build a working Machine learning model for the detection of multiple facesand recognizing them and relating them to their original subject using the input of a thermal camera(Optris 3000) based on previousresearchers work in the field and on similar applications. I learned and applied Deep learning techniques in creating a model, trainingit and optimizing it, I also gathered data from subjects, preprocessed them and built a pipeline for forwarding them to the models inproper format and batches ready for immediate use. I also experienced working on real life models and fine tuning them to matchthe behavior of a real life scenario.Internship
