 The internship started with one month of onboarding which was a fair amount of time for me to get to know the companyâ€™s technology stack and work environments. After that, | was to choose which team to join. | joined the integrations team as | was interested in the projects assigned to this team. At the beginning of the internship, | was assigned to testing tasks. After that, the integrations team was assigned to a project that integrates with an external service. It was a tracking service for the sales agents on the map. | was assigned to the research of this project at the beginning to define its requirements and time estimate. | did the research and then after | was assigned to the project itself. We started the implementation depending on the documentation provided by the other company and created its unit testing. This part had some issues because we did not have the credintials from the external company. After we got the credintials, we updated our implementation to accomodate to the new changes. The project took about 5 month to be finished. During this time, | had my hands on new technologies such as Node.js, MySQL, and API integrations.
