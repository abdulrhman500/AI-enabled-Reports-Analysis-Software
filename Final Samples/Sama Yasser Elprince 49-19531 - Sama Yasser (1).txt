tasks: First of all, we were introduced to web development and its different parts, we learned the difference between front and backend and each oneâ€™s tasks and used technologies and languages, we were given a brief about the history of web development and where do we stand now. We then started learning frontend from scratch, we started by html and CSS and we were asked to implement a design of a responsive website using them and to try as much as we can to be accurate in implementing the design. After that we moved on to learning JavaScript and performed tasks using it such as getting data from an API, building dynamic parts of the page, handling errors and exceptions, authentication, and many other topics. We then were introduced to TypeScript and we learned the differences between TypeScript and JavaScript and when to use what and were asked to redo some tasks using TypeScript and compared the two codes to be able to see the impact of using TypeScript. At the same time, we started learning Bootstrap and understood how it works and how to build what we want in a more efficient way and less code, we used all these previous technologies to build an e-commerce fashion website using an API, in this website a user can view products, filter and order them based on a certain attribute, search for a specific product, sign in and out, add/remove product to cart, view his cart, etc. After we finished building this website, we started learning Angular 5 from scratch, I learned how to divide my project into reusable components which is cleaner and more efficient, I learned and implemented the idea of routing and navigation through the website, how to implement services, I also learned about authentication and authorization using tokens and how to display a specific view based on the type of user. We then used all this knowledge to reimplement the e-commerce website that we built before using Angular 5. In addition to all of that, I learned about version control using git and GitHub and used it in building the projects with other team members in addition to using google dev tools, I also learned how to write a clean code and how to refactor my code to be efficient.
