 In this internship, | was assigned to be a software engineer, who is responsible for creating a responsive and functional website, make a API cache and dockerize it then convert it to a web app for a TV that works with webOS ( Like LG TVs ). My usual day work was that | get there at 9AM and start working till 4PM. | have talks with my supervisor about other projects and used to ask him many questions to get use of his big knowledge and experience. Some other days were online from home. We have meetings during the week to discuss how the tasks had been performed and to get feedback on them and what to improve and so on. The software tools | used were Angular JS for creating the front-end, spatial-navigation-js ( by luke-chang) library to handle the navigation on the TVs, LG TVs emulator, docker to dockerize the project, Github to organize the project and make it accessible for the supervisors, @angular/pwa to do the API caching, Postman to test the APIs, bootstrap for angular to get some components , Firebase to deploy my app and had to handle somethings to set up the environment for LG developers mode on my laptop. | had to do a research to find out how TV apps are handled and how they differ from the normal website and how big companies like Netflix handle them and | searched how to optimize my app because TVs got weak  processors and low memory size.
