activities My task was to develop a light-independent fiducial marker system for swarm robots. I focused mainly on the usage of computer vision to detect multiple swarm robots in a zero-light intensity room. My typical working day started at 10 AM and Continued to around 7 PM. I worked in two labs one was a normal lab (with a PC and desk) and the other one was a swarm lab which contains multiple cameras and swarm robots to test my work on. I worked with two Ph.D. holders who helped supervise me during the project. During the project, I worked with Python, Arduino C, and embedded systems. I also worked with a soldering machine as a big part of my project demanded building a physical hardware device. I have performed substantial research on multiple fields from image, ultrasonic, and RFID detection, among others, and worked with them in practical situations.
