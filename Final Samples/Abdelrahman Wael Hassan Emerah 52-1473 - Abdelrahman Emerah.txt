 | took a part in providing the company a service as | was asked to create a website that enables itworkians to communicate internal with a restricted access using user name and passwords. that were given to me as a database and | linked this database with the website the website goal is to make employee share their codes so if someone is struggling he can find a way to complete his work this website was accessible using a phone and laptop it was created using wordpress and some javascript and css. Working days was flexible and there was an option of working from home. I did some researches as | wasn't aware of how to use wordpress so I watched on YouTube how to use it and searched from plugins that will help me. Unfortunately | was working on the company's laptop so I donâ€™t have access to this website any more
