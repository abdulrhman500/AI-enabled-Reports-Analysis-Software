tasks:Before beginning the internship activities, we had a look at the various webdevelopment frameworks and when each one should be used. In order to introduce us to theworld of software development, which demands the mastery of problem-solving techniques,we also conducted problem-solving exercises.The following phase involved choosing the framework for a web development projectthat had been assigned to us. We chose to utilise strapi for the backend and next js for thefrontend.I was working on two tasks simultaneously because it was my first time to use strapi: Iwas learning strapi and conducting research while analysing the database to determine theentities and the relationships among them. During this phase I was seeing the practical use ofthe database course that we studied in semester 5 and put it to use. We also had regularmeetings with the team working on the frontend to share our progress together.Later on, after I had learned more about strapi and had a good understanding of thedatabase, my task was to create the tables using strapi and add the attributes. The crucial stepthat connects the frontend and backend—and ultimately ties everything together—came next.Internship
