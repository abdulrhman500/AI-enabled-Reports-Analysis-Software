activities: I had my internship in the information security department under the direct supervision of Mr.Abbas El - Awadi My main task during my internship period was database administration. I would run/write queries for specific databases using MySQL and PL/SQL (depending on the required task) for things such as employee's attendance (finding out who came at what time, who was late, etc) and annual holidays count (for each employee how many days of annual leave do they have yet). I was always supervised by my direct supervisor while doing so due to the confidentiality of the department and the corporation itself.  Sometimes I had to write queries to find out the name of the Head Teller at a specific branch across Egypt for example find out his/her history and their previous positions at different branches, give this certain person access to specific software (Oracle core banking system) and such.  The systems I worked on are confidential/sensitive as they contain bank information so I couldnâ€™t use pictures directly from said systems.
