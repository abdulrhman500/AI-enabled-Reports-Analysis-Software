- The report discusses the internship experience at the GUC campus, specifically working on the development of an autonomous bike.
- The objective of joining the project was to gain practical experience using hardware.
- The internship provided knowledge about the architecture of building the autonomous bike and the opportunity to continue working in the research cluster.
- The GUC is a private educational non-profit institute founded in 2002 and cooperates with the State Universities of Ulm and Stuttgart.
- The research cluster is supervised by Professor Hassan Soubra in the Media Engineering Technology Major in the Engineering department.
- The goal of the research cluster is to develop an autonomous bike that can function in the real world.
- The task of the intern was to build and run a resizable neural network on the Nividia Jetson Nano computer that is used in the bike system.
- The neural network is used to classify objects detected by the camera mounted on the bike, which helps in decision-making.
- Important skills gained include dealing with Ubuntu and using the terminal, as well as building neural networks.
- The internship exceeded expectations, with a helpful and supportive team.
- The experience helped the intern gain knowledge about implementing neural networks and running them on the Nividia Jetson Nano computer.
- The internship is related to the field of smart systems and is highly relevant to the Computer Science field.
- The embedded systems course was the most related to the internship.
- The internship experience at the GUC was considered the best decision for the summer, with a motivating working environment, the opportunity to improve Python skills, access to necessary hardware, and a collaborative workspace.
- The intern learned a lot and worked with a wonderful and helpful team.
