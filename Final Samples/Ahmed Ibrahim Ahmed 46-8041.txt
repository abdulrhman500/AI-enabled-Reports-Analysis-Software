Tasks   Month 1:  We started by meeting the administration staff to know more about the requirements needed and the features that needed to be implemented. The hard constraints that cannot be broken were agreed upon along with other soft constraints. We researched a couple of different algorithms in a couple of different meetings with the rest of the team and eventually we decided to use The Genetic Algorithm with Shotgun-Hill Climbing.  Month 2: Starting the 2nd month, we started implementing the algorithm. Which consisted of different parts that were split among us. My main task was to implement the evaluating algorithm, which is responsible for evaluating every new randomly generated neighbor schedule and optimize it to decrease the cost function as much as possible. Every iteration every newly generated neighbor schedule enters the evaluating algorithm to be optimized as much as decreasing itâ€™s cost function until we eventually reach a cost function of zero, which would be our optimal solution.  Month 3 and the remaining 2 weeks:  For the last month more testing and optimization were done for the evaluating algorithm, trying to reach a cost function of zero in the lowest number of iterations possible to decrease the time needed to come up with the final schedule. And testing the actual defense scheduling that were used for the last two years to check for any errors and bugs that had to be fixed.        Internship
