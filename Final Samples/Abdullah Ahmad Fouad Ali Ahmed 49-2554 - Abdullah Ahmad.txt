Tasks: (Not less than 100 words)  The internship included 3 Projects , each project Included several milestones/stages. For the first task we were asked to create a web page identical to udemy.com 's home page using html,css,javascript. We were not allowed to use any front-end library/framework , however we were allowed to use css frameworks , and some parts of the page it was obligatory to use a certain css framework (namely bootstrap).
