 We were a team of 3 and the internship was a 6-week internship where each week, we had different tasks that were individual. The first task was to extract 100 audios using Audacity where the sampling rate had to be 44100 and each audio had to range from | to 9 second long and this task was weekly as each participant had to make a total of 400-500 audios at the end of the internship. We used the "Hya and Da Vinci" series to extract those audios and we were given 6 emotion to choose from that were Neutral, Happy, Sad, Fearful, Angry and Surprised. Each week every one of us was given 5 episodes to extract the audios and we were given a datasheet that had some columns, one was for the name of the audios that consisted of the speaker ID and the emotion of the audio and a number for how many times that audio got repeated. The 2nd column was for the speaker ID that was the name of the actor, the 3rd column was for the gender, the 4th was for the age group, the Sth was for Main label that was the emotion that the participant that extracted the audios thinks that is the suitable one, the 6th was for the series name and there were another 4 columns and they were for the other 2 participants to enter their name and the emotion they think is suitable for that one audio.  The second week, we had to do another task beside the extracting audios task, where it was a coding task done using Python programming language and Google Colab Editor and basically we had to do some statistics on the datasheet for example how many female/male audios, the number of each emotion, the number of audios for one actor which is the number of speaker ID and the number of each group age. Following on, we had to make a voting method that gets the most repeated emotion out of the 3 votes for each team member for each audio and  4  Student Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt  QSUC SCAD  adjust that audio name in the datasheet and in the drive to it, but if the 3 votes were different, then we leave the audio name in both locations as is.  The 3rd and last task was about removing silence and noise out of the audios as we take another copy of the original audios and then we apply the removing silence method and removing noise method on them and then we save them on drive.
