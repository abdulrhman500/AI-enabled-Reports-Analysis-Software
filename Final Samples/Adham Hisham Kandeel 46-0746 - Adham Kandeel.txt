 In my first month, I had to get familiar with the new frameworks and language the company was using, which is Laravel, Vuejs and PHP. I started taking an online course in Laravel then I progressed to Laravel integrated with Vuejs for backend and frontend. After my first month I have concluded my learning phase, then I was assigned several tasks regarding the backend and software testing eras of our fleet system (A system that is used by fleet managers to monitor fleet activities and make decisions about proper asset  management, dispatch and routing, and vehicle acquisition and disposal). Firstly, I was assigned  Scanned with CamScanner  to create the models of our database, each model containing 4 main methods the save, data, remove and restore methods. In addition, I was assigned to create the controllers for several models each controller has 5 main methods. The first method is the index method of type POST which when called it retums all the data in the specified table. The second method is also of type POST which is the put method which allows the user to input new data to the table. The third method is of type GET and it is the get method which requires a required parameter such as ID so that the method can return the specified record. The final two methods are the remove and restore methods which both methods require required parameters to identify which field is specified for removal and restoral. Moreover, I was assigned to create the APIs of the methods I have created in the controllers and I used SQL to create all the full tables necessary for our Fleet system. After creating everything mentioned above, I used Postman to test all my APIs and methods and I used Laragon Apache Server to apply all the above to our Phpmyadmin database to assure that everything was working as it should be. Finally, I had to push my work on Bitbucket because we were 5 people working simultaneously on this project therefore our can be  integrated together properly.
