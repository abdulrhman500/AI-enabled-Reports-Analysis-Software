Tasks: (Not less than 100 words)  During this internship I have been introduced to a new programming language that I had never used before. It’s just a part of Java language with more details and depth. For sure I was introduced to Java at university in the very beginning of the semester but we were not introduced to this Java framework which is Java Spring & Java Spring Boot. In the first week, I was required to get introduced to this framework by using online resource so it was basically a research-based task. Then I was required to create new Get and Post requests using Java Spring Boot and using REST controllers and some annotations using the built-in components and Annotations in Java Spring. I was also required to build relationships between a newly created Entity (‘Locations’) and link them to already existing Entities in the Postgres DB by using Java Data JPA. Along with, testing the new requests that I created using Postman. Internship
