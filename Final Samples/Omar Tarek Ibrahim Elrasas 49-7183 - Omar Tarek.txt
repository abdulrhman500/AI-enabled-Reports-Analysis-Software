Tasks:   During the first half of my working period, I was part of the extension team where we developed extensions for Magento 2 and provided compatibility for old extensions to newer versions of Magento 2 and then they were sold on the company owned digital marketplace called ScandiPWA marketplace. Then I was transferred to the service cloud team which is the team that provides on-demand client support where clients report issues or feature requests, and the team tries to implement them in the shortest possible time. My usual working day goes like this, I start with a meeting with my team called daily stand up (DS) lead by the project manager, where each developer describes what they completed the previous day, the problems they faced if any, and what they will start working on, then I check my assigned tasks on Jira which is an agile project management web application and the tasks are assigned by the project manager, then I provide an estimation of how many hours this task should take and what will be done to complete it, then wait for the client's approval, and once I get the client's approval I can start working on the task, and if I get stuck, I can ask developers from my team or my mentor who is a senior developer using Slack which is an app used for professional communication between an organization's members. Once I complete a task, I push changes to Bitbucket which is a Git-based cloud web application optimized for teams using Jira that is similar to GitHub, send the pull request link to my mentor to review it, once accepted, I deploy using Bamboo which is a CI/CD tool used for automated project building and testing. After testing, I inform the client that changes are deployed so they can review the changes and then I can move the ticket status to done, and finally send a daily report to my project manager of what I did today.
