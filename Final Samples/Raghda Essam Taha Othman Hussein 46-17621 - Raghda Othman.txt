Tasks:In this internship the first task was to study an online course to make sure that everyone has the same basicknowledge. The course was offered by Andrew Ng on Youtube. The course is mainly covering machinelearning with all its aspects and details. After finishing the course a task was assigned to each team. We wereasked to compare between different types of clustering algorithms. We chose Density-based clustering,Distribution-based clustering, Hierarchical clustering, and Centroid-based clustering to perform our task on. Wegot a data set to apply the algorithms on and performed data preprocessing on it to remove anything that we didnot want or unnecessary. After applying each clustering algorithm using python in jupyter notebook, acomparison between them was made. Another task was to locate each atm of Banque Misr and National Bankof Egypt and present them on a map. The first thing that was done was data scraping using an online api foreach atm of the banks to get its address and another online api to get each addressâ€™s longitude and latitude to beable to locate it on the map. Some data preprocessing was made on the data to ensure that these are the atms wewant. Then we presented the atms on the map using power pi. The visualization included all the atms of the twobanks and you can choose a certain governorate to view its atms or even view one atm on the map. The last taskwas to estimate the population using satellite images. We achieved the data using an online source code inpython and got these photos as our data and applied some data preprocessing on it and then applied a neuralnetwork algorithm to it to predict using python on jupyter notebook.Internship
