 I began the Internship in September 2022 and finished it in October 2022. Firstly I got introduced to three main languages in my filed (HTML , CSS and Javascript) . I have learned them from scratch and I searched a lot during this internship to be able to gain more information and knowledge about them . I have created a webpage from scratch using these courses that I have leamed and applying each information that I have learnt so far in them. The webpage was a webpage like daily dev.com which is the fastest growing online community for developers to stay updated on the best developer news.
