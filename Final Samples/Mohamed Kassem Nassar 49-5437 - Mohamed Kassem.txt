 As an intern at Optima Professional Services you need to have a background on Networks in General and the Palo Alto firewalls and Panorama specifically. I already had great knowledge about network layers and Packet tracing from the two Network courses CSEN503 and DMET602 instructed by Dr. Amr El Mogy in addition to a CCNA course I studied, but I had to get familiar with Palo alto firewalls, their  configuration and maintenance through courses and videos and shadowing my  IV.  supervisor. My tasks were to keep studying the Palo Alto firewall configurations in parallel while practicing what I learned so far in lab tasks and simulations of real-life maintenance problems the IT department faced. I was also asked to make a Presentation in front of my direct manager and the IT department about the network layer history in detail.
