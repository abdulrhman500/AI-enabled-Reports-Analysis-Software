Tasks: The internship began by a familiarization period towards the ERP software system used by SAP and brief explanation of the technical and functional modules of SAP. I was working with ABAP which is a high-level programming language created by SAP that helps large corporations to customize the SAP ERP. I worked with internal tables to retrieve data from database tables using ABAP and using OPEN SQL in ABAP. I also created classical reports to display information stored in the database.
