Tasks: I was given a position on the development team, which oversaw webapp development. Before assigning us tasks to complete, they taught us a lot throughout the internship. These were the things I learned:    - How to build a website's Backend using Java Spring Boot    - How to design a website's Frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript    - How to store data in a NoSQL database    - Different frameworks used to create webapps like ReactJS  These were applied to develop a full stack web application that provides customers with questionnaires and stores their answers in Firebaseâ€™s Firestore Database where it is evaluated and analyzed. Implemented a variety of full-stack features, including a RESTful API using Java Spring Boot, and dynamic client-side interfaces with ReactJS.   Internship
