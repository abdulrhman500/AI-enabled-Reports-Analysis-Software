 Internship activities  In the work field, I was so impressed by being surrounded by experts who were working on different projects. they were all discussing the problems facing them and bugs with each other. So I was able to have a look at all the problems and their solutions. And Whenever I hear a new word or face a new error, I search for it to know more about it and get used to it.  They were using many software applications, and I had to learn them first before helping them.
