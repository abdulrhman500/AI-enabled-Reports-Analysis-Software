46-3674 - Ali Helmy,Approved,"Tasks:The internship programme has three primary components. The initial step was to connect the laptop that usesVR to the car, such as by receiving sensor and video feeds from the vehicle. The second method involved givingthe car commands like steer, accelerate, and brake via a cloud. The VR controllers, which were programmed tocommunicate with the car, are what send these commands.The final component of the haptic gloves is what simulates driving an automobile. The gloves received specificinformation from the car via a cloud and translated it to various vibration levels depending on the roadconditions and the motion of the car.The interns were given different parts to work on, and we all collaborated because each aspect is interconnected.Internship "
49-1249 Hesham Shawkat Raslan  Internship Report - TheRaslanz,Approved,"Tasks: At the start of the internship, we all met (the interns) and our mentors gave us some time to get to know each other and feel more comfortable because they said it will lead to a better and more productive workspace and we were then assigned into teams of 3 and given to us was our first task which was to view and understand the database schema (using MS SQL) of the company then we were gathered to make sure we all the same view for the schema and discuss further improvement. We then had the big task that was going to take up most of our time, Our mentor told us to imagine we have a client (in this case it is the company) and they need a designed interface therefore our goal was to plan and implement dashboard for admins in order to manipulate the company database. To start we used AST.Net Framework to create the backend APIÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢s that we saw that they may be needed , for example we implemented the get , post, delete , patch APIÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢s. We then started working on Angular HTML and CSS to start implementing our front end for the dashboard, which made things on the easier side to connect our front end to backend by proxying/sending requests from front to back end. Every couple of days we were asked as a task, to code review our teammates which had the purpose of making us all see different perspectives and thinking processes as well as getting a sense of organizing our code. We were also asked to research more about the applications/software we were using so we can widen our knowledge about what we have in hand.  Internship "

Abdallah_Elsayed_Abdo_46_17899 - Abdallah Arafa,Approved,"Activities:In this internship. I was trying to research and apply different techniques of combining differenttrained models to improve their performance metric. I did my research on two tasks: the first wasSpeech Recognition and the second was Neural Machine Translation. This task was an individualtask however, I was supervised by two mentors: Andrew Baher for Speech Recognition andEvram Narrouz for Neural Machine Translation. I was working five days per week for 8 hoursevery day. I could either work from home or go work at the company and I chose to go to thecompany once or twice a week. My typical working day started with having a meeting witheither one of my supervisors that I was supposed to work on his task to plan the day and what Iam supposed to do for the day. Most of the time, I was performing experiments by trainingmodels with different hyperparameters. While waiting for the models to finish training, I used toread articles on new ways to average these models or new techniques to come up with newexperiments to perform. After training the models, I ran the average models code that I haveprepared for the experiment and when the results are ready, I communicate them to mysupervisor in order to discuss their gains and whether they were significant or not. Then, wediscuss the implications of our findings and propose new ideas to experiment. The tools that Ihave used are different between the two tasks however, Python was the main language that I usedto code with, azure storage was the main database that stored all the models and datasets, andamlt was the main platform to train the different models on it. The timeline of the internshipwent as follows: I first started by reading different papers about model averaging and discussedthem with my supervisor until we decided that we should start working with one of them. Inorder to execute that method, we had to train 16 different models so I was asked to write theconfiguration files for training speech recognition models with different hyperparameters andsubmitting them to training on Azure itp cluster machines. While waiting for them to finishtraining I was supposed to design the algorithm for averaging them. I was supposed to do that ona program called AEther for multiprocessing, but there was a problem that AEther could not givefeedback in the same module for each step so I had to write the code from scratch and thatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢s whatI did. I spent almost 2-3 weeks writing the code for averaging and integrating it with the codebase of Microsoft for evaluating their speech recognition models. After getting the first resultsfrom the speech recognition experiment, we decided that I should do the same with the NMTtask and embed my averaging code with TorchSpeech modules and this took me another twoweeks. This took me a total of six weeks to run one experiment on each task and I had 2 weeksleft for my internship. ThatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢s when my supervisors asked  me to extend my internship to continuemy experiments on the two tasks. For the last 6 weeks, I started exploring with my supervisorsdifferent ideas for each task, some of them included exploring larger datasets to see how muchgain the algorithm would have. I also explored the custom translators in NMT, where the modeltrained on a domain specific dataset like Medicine did well on this dataset but it usually did wayworse on the basic English sentences so I was asked to try model averaging on this model tobalance between its performance on the domain specific dataset and the general one as well.At the end of my internship, I managed to deliver the average models that usually did a little bitbetter than the stand alone trained models. This applied on both tasks and on the differentdatasets and domain specific tasks.Internship "

Ahmed Ayman Mamdouh Abdelmonem Eloraby 46_3547 - Ahmed Eloraby,Approved,"Tasks: The internship operated in a hybrid mode. The majority internship period we used to go to the university especially if we needed to conduct a meeting with the supervisors. For some days we used to work remotely. A typical working day started by discussing the tasks to be performed during the day at about 10:00am and it usually ended at around 5:00pm.  Since the majority of the internes did not have any previous knowledge about supply chains and creating graph visuals, we spent the first week researching into mentioned topics to understand the structure of the supply chains, to learn about the techniques used to model supply chains and finally to understand the benefits of modeling supply chain as a graph. During research, we learned about the components of supply chains and the different tiers (levels) it is composed of. In addition, we came across the SCOR model (supply chain operations reference) which has a purpose to aid in standardizing the process and create a measurable way to track results. Moreover, we found out about a type of graphs used to model supply chains called Petrinet. We were provided a dataset which holds randomly generated records to model a supply chain. After gaining adequate knowledge about supply chain, we began transforming the dataset into tables of nodes and edges which will be later used in visualization using python. During transformation process, we heavily relied on pandas and numpy libraries. The transformation pipeline is as follows:   Data Cleaning and Classifying Creating Nodes and edges Tables Reading Dataset transformation Tables  ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Firstly, we imported the data set using pandas, each table as a dataframe. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Secondly, we began the cleaning and transformation process. To start with, some columns were interpreted as strings though they were actually containing numeric or list items.  We created new columns from the original data with the correct data type. Moving on, some tables were split into smaller tables to differentiate between different types. Furthermore, since the dataset was randomly generated, some tablesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢ records did not make match with other tablesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢ records, we added new records to some tables to overcome this issue.  Additionally, we replaced all missing values with specific values we agreed on with the supervisor. Lastly, we removed all tables that will not be considered in later steps. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Thirdly, for each table, we searched for primary and foreign keys it includes. We assumed that the dataset did not contain any composite key. Subsequently, tables were classified into 3 classes according to the number of foreign keys in the table as follows: Class Number of Foreign keys Description Node 0 Main components of the supply chain Edge 2 Relations between nodes Property 1 Details about nodes/edges  *Tables that did not fall under any of these classes were handled individually. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Last but not least, all tables classified as nodes or edges were condensed into 2 tables; a node table and edges table. The edges table contains relations between nodes. Two approaches were considered while representing tables classified as property. The first approach is to add tablesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢ records as attributes to nodes or edges. Though this approach resulted in an accurate representation of the supply chain, it was difficult to visualize a property when a node or an edge contains a lot of properties. Another approach we considered is to create nodes for each property and to link it with an edge or a node. Nonetheless, in the majority of visualizing tools edges only connect between two nodes. Therefore, we decided to represent edges as nodes to be able to connect it with more than one node.   After creating edges and nodes tables, we selected couple visualization tools and each member of the team was assigned a specific tool one to test on our tables. The tools we used are Pyvis (python library), Networx (python library), Gephi and Neo4j.  I was responsible about creating a graph using Neo4j. Neo4j is a non-open source graph database management system developed by Neo4j and contains many tools for visualization such as Neo4j browser and Neo4j Bloom. Before using Neo4j, I needed to study cypher which is the query language used by Neo4j. Moreover, to integrate our python project with neo4j database, we needed to include Neo4j python diver to our project to connect with the graph database and to be able to execute cypher queries from python.  To visualize our tables, we needed to insert every record from nodes and edges tables into the database by executing specific cypher queries.  Figures in the Appendix section shows the visualization created using both mentioned approaches and obtained using different tools. Figure 1 shows the result of visualizing properties as attributes using Pyvis. It is obvious that the attributes are not easily readable and sometimes it can overflow. Figure 2, 3,4 show a zoomed out picture of the whole data set through representing nodes as edges and properties using Pyvis, Neo4j Bloom and Neo4j Browser respectively. Figure 5 shows a zoomed in picture of the supply chain. Each class was assigned a different color to facilitate the process of differentiating between classes easily.   Internship "

It was my job to create the frontend of the checkout page, but unlike the first task, this task was far more challenging because of the many components and complexity involved. I created the cart component that included the items checked in using the barcode scanner. The item was another component that included the name, price, and serial number. Additionally, I worked on developing the transaction and customer information components, including the total price of the items, the taxes, and customer information such as his/her name and phone number. All of these components were implemented using Angular and styled using CSS.   One of the things I was exposed to during my internship was how difficult it is to deal with clients.

As a software developer, I had to compensate by making the software perform as fast and efficiently as possible using clean and efficient code that doesn't overload the hardware. Among the simple techniques that I learned and used was to avoid and eliminate any unnecessary operations and variables and to break loops when necessary. This helps decrease the load on the hardware and allows the software to perform better.    As to the working condition, the typical working day was 9-5. There was a product manager, a team lead, and multiple software developers on every project. The tasks I was assigned were all under the supervision of a software developer that taught me the different technologies and helped me understand and finish the tasks. In most cases, I communicated with my supervisors by phone or using Whatsapp.   Internship "
Ahmed Mohamed Ramadan 46-16589 - Ahmed Ramadan,Approved,"Tasks:During this internship, I worked on an e-commerce application called Green Corner. My work in the internshipcan be divided into three parts. The first part is front-end development using Kotlin and android studio, thesecond part includes UI/UX work and The third part is back-end development, which was done using C#,Microsoft Dot Net core, dapper and entity framework. While the previously mentioned parts are of courseimplemented for every feature, most of the time I havenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢t done all the parts for the same feature, meaning that,for example, I have worked on the front-end part only for some features and the same goes for other parts. As4Student Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egyptfor the front-end part, the work was mostly done on features that are already implemented but needed someediting, so for example the cart page didnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢t have the option to search the items that were added to the cart by thecustomer and filter them according to the search text, it was a requirement to add this feature, and it wasassigned to me to do it and I did. The UI/UX part was mostly done with the front end part, However, on somepages, I have made changes to the UI without any changes in functionality, such as for example changing thecolour of some tabs and changing the shape of some icons like the search and cart icons. I have also suggested adesign of the UI/UX of some pages with new features using Figma. As for the back end part, I have worked onnew features, one feature was for the patients to upload the prescription to the application, where theprescription should be saved in the applicationÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢s database and be associated with the customer. Also, there areoptions for the customer to retrieve, edit, or delete his/her previous prescriptions uploaded. I have used an entityframework to work with the database, as the approach used was code-first.These are some screenshots from the application during different stages of development:When observing the leftmost and the middle photos, for example, there are some changes in the upper tab thatcan be observed. In the upper tab (fixed on all pages), the colour of it has been changed, the theme of the iconshas changed and there were some features added such as the heart (go to favourites page) and the menu buttonon the left which on click shows the sidebar menu. The rightmost picture shows the feature of selecting acategory from the left sidebar menu and a subcategory from the right.

Alia Ahmed Saddik Mohamed Saleh [46-7537] - Alia Saddik,Approved,"Tasks:              The tasks we worked on during this internship varied from courses, projects, research, and presentations. We took various courses and many presentations about the company functions and software used were presented by the engineers. Golang, Flask, Docker, Django, and GitHub actions resources were provided by the supervisor for us to study. Also, presentations about the whole  ThreeFold  (their current customer) eco-system, how it works, and how a user can use in addition to all the technologies that are included in the whole development cycle of the project were provided by the engineers who worked on it. The projects we worked on included a simple Golang INI file parser with its unit tests and GitHub actions that ran them. Also, a full stack to-do web app that was later containerized using docker. This web app was built using Golang and mongo DB for the backend and svelte and typescript for the front end. The backend was tested using the Golang unit tests, and postman and open-API (swagger API) was built to ensure the robustness of the backend. Cypress was used to test the front end.  The GitHub actions for this project automated the build and updated the image for the docker container and ran all the tests. Another mini project was a telegram bot that was built using python, this project was containerized using the threefold ecosystem. Finally, we worked on a new HR system web app for Codescalers-Egypt employees. For the backend, I worked on authentication and authorization using JWT and Django.  I also worked on all the user profile operations for all types of users (admins, supervisors and employees). For the front end, I used svelte and typescript to incorporate authentication and authorization in the front end. In addition to building the login and registration pages. Regarding the research, research was held about IPFS planning services to discuss it with the decision makers for Codescalers to start using it in their current project. Finally, a presentation was prepared and held for my colleagues, supervisor and the project manager about web3.  Internship "

Amr Salama_37-5028 - Amr Salama,Approved,"Tasks:In this internship, I was tasked to handle the CCTV cameras as well as the database it stores the data on. So I would check thecameras in each cluster and make sure they were working correctly, and that they were in the correct location, looking at the correctangle and making sure they did not have any objects obscure the view. Since the CCTV system was a Huawei one, I was usingHolosens and E-Sight to make sure the CCTV system was working as intended. As for the database, all of the footage that thecameras captured were stored on a local server which then a powerful PC analized the raw data using computer vision and machinelearning to detect, recognize and identify certain objects such as people, license plates, animals, etc. This data is then stored back onthe server.

To be accepted, my team and | were asked to write a report summarizing a primary research on the topic and describing a clear roadmap for the internship's goals. Afterwards, we were provided weekly milestones to work on throughout the week and present our work the following meeting. After the first meeting, the objective became clearer which was to have a middle module that will enable us to stream whatever was on the camera on another device without the constant need fora laptop. Our first milestone was to perform a literature review. making sure no one already implemented something similar to what we are doing, looking for potential useful libraries, and searching for any pre-existing software for the camera model we're using. We were then introduced to the RaspberryPi as a preferred component to work with. After some research, we figured we can install NodeJS and visual studio code customized for the RaspberryPi's operating system. This was of great help as javaScript is a language that has many resources and libraries, and we were all trying to get more familiar with it, Next, we found an API that enabled streaming the contents of any connected camera to a website. So, as a result of the second milestone, we ended up with an elementary website that runs on the RaspberryPi and displays the camera stream on any Screen connected to it through an HDMI cable. After the third milestone, we were able to capture separate frames and perform character recognition using predefined libraries to read and output the temperatures written out on the frames. During the final milestone, we used image processing that enabled us to find temperature of separate pixels, depending on their colors and the color scale, as opposed to just reading the temperature displayed. Finally, we worked on some optimizations like handling the user choosing which camera to stream in  Student Career & Alumni Development Office, scai)c GUS. eol.ea | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt  GUC SCAD  aie QU dos  case of connecting multiple cameras to the RaspberryPi, as well as, improving the GUI of the webpage we were working with.

Farah Walid Ghonema 46-0728 - Farah Walid,Approved,"Tasks: I joined the web development sector at VERO to work on a face recognition application project for IHOP restaurants, an American multinational pancake house restaurant chain that specializes in American breakfast foods. I worked as a full stack developer and joined another colleague to work on this project. Together we managed to fully develop and deliver the application successfully. The application is launched on a touch screen at the IHOP restaurant in Cairo Festival City Mall. Its main idea is to ask people to smile, detect their faces and smiles, and based on these detections it makes an assumption about their mood and suggests a dish from the IHOP menu to match the clientÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢s mood. It also has the IHOP menu available, if someone only wants to see the menu. The project was written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and we used the ElectronJS Framework. I was not familiar at first with the Framework, so I had to do some research to introduce myself to the framework. I also had to take several courses in order to learn how to write CSS and proper HTML files since I did not work with them professionally before. Next, me and my partner both researched the face recognition libraries available and chose to use the MediaPipe library provided by Google to recognize faces in our application. My daily routine involved joining the online scrum meetings with the rest of the company, having a separate meeting with my colleague to discuss and assign our tasks, and then I sit on my desk at home and begin by first pulling all the updates pushed on GitHub and then start coding my assigned tasks. At the end of the day, I would commit and push my work on GitHub and so will my co-worker. I visited the office once a week to work there with my colleague and we had several meetings with the IHOP board. My tasks involved initializing the desktop application, writing HTML and CSS files to build and style the pages of the application and building the algorithm to detect peopleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢s mood. The algorithm mainly was based on detecting faces using MediaPipe and using the MediaPipe landmarks (coordinates) to calculate how big the person is smiling (the bigger the smile the happier a user is). A score is calculated for each userÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢s smile using our developed score function, and then the userÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢s mood is categorized either as happy or sad. Following that, a dish is suggested from the menu corresponding to the correct mood category. We faced many challenges while coding. One of the challenges faced was that the MediaPipe library took so long to load, and until it loaded the camera canvas was frozen on the screen. In order to overcome this challenge, I decided to divide the application into threads, so that we can load the MediaPipe library at the beginning of the applicationÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢s launch, so the screen does not freeze.

Hatem Naier Mohamed Ahmed Dawa 46-6959 - Hatem Nier,Approved," In the first initial phase we had a 4 weeks period for brainstorming in order to setup the interns for the objectives they will be tackling throughout the whole period. At first, we were just having meetings for illustration of tasks, goals, milestones, and the expected finalized results. Accordingly, we soon started working in groups of 8 interns, there were always 2 different groups that interchange weekly. The first group was group ""Soft"" in which its main goal was to configure, monitor and troubleshoot using python 3 scripts on Jupyter Notebook. We used to have basic small network designs in cisco and run all the components using ready scripts. For example, a switch can be configured in four lines of code instead of writing many commands in cisco. Also, for the part of monitoring, it was like packet tracing but with some protocols for insurance. We were putting these protocols for monitoring using scripted conditions for example, bandwidth, distance, power and priority. Troubleshooting was a little harder than the previous tasks as you can have a traceback to where the packet have stopped, changed route, or even had a turn around, but yet sometimes we could not solve the issue, even if we know where it was. It appeared that the conditional scripts may have too strict conditions or very loose  Student Career & Alumni Development Office. scadouc edu.co | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tegamoa Al Khames; Egypt  CamScanner  qouc SCAD  conditions that are not generalized for all types of small networks so we had to change the script itself or update it manually in the code. The second group was the ""Fellow"" group in which interns were testing the scripted tool. We were running various commands and collecting its outputs in external files and then validating them with our objective. We also used templates to create new configurations and load these configurations on a sample network device. After the training period has finished, Interns started meetings with the head of operation department along with the team leaders that used to give us our first training period. Meetings lasted 2 weeks for the discussion of the milestones of the actual Automation software design being built from scratch, We discussed which types of test scripts would be used and visualized some sample global networks with identification of each component. After the 2 weeks period, we resumed with the research part, we took multiple intro sessions but the period was mainly for self-research about cloud servers and some of its models, The most important one was the pyramid model of 3 layers IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Infrastructure is where one manages Servers, OS, Virtualization. Platform is where one manages applications while third-party vendor manages networking and storage. Finally, Software as a Service allows third-party vendor to manage all applications and data allowing the business to access the interface, I also researched the characteristics of cloud like elasticity, scalability, duplicability, on-demand service and automation, The main project was to test the automation tool on a hexagonal model, each containing 3 stations. The objective was to examine data transfer between stations using Genex Cloud, saving outputs in a database server, and mainly testing the tool. We worked on an E-commerce application (basic online products interface) for testing. For the remaining 5 weeks we worked on the cloud testing part in which interactions occur between various stations on the E-commerce application. First was to set for Functional Testing in which we managed to put the functional requirements for the application, for example, Log In, Sign Up, System Shutdown, After that we started the most interesting part as we were testing thresholds to ensure stability with different number of users accessing the cloud server by scaling in/out the load, We then started Performance Testing to establish certain steps considering the performance of the application such as consistency across the different devices. Finally, we started testing the Automation tool as we worked on Network Testing by checking connectivity of the devices and data integrity to insure a secure Environment. It could also allow us to receive reports for unaccepted behaviors. For the final week of the internship, each intern had an evaluation for the whole project by the team leaders with an evaluation for the project itself for any updates.  "

The supervisor provided a list of names for the actors that we need to extract their voices. I started extracting audio files from the episodes from 6 to 10 using audacity software to record their emotions which varied between ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ…â€œhappy ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“ sad ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“ neutral ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“ angry ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“ fearful ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“ surprised ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ…â€œ. Using Eclipse IDE and Java Programming language I was able to build program that can provide me with statistics for my Dataset and decides for each record which emotion gets the highest voting as for each record, as each member listens to the records of other team members and writes the emotion he felt from the voice based on his point of view, as a result we can reach to a more efficient result for each record   The previous snap shows some statistics for the first series. A new series was then assigned to us ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“ Al Zeybaq ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“ and I kept extracting records until I reached the target set for me ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ…â€œ 500 records ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ…â€œ and Also I listened to total of 1500 records which were extracted by my friends and I added my suggestion for the emotion I heard from the actor voice. Then by applying the technique I developed with Java. The program made a voting based on our suggestions and added the final result with the most accurate emotion. We also attended a meeting with Prof. Mohamed Salem. At which we saw the result of our hard working as our team along with other teams were able to build a huge dataset for Egyptian speech (more than 15000 records ) from which 6000 records were examined with All needed tests and it was valid and showing really good results for the current machine learning project.

Hazem_Hisham_Omran_Hassan_46-13128_SalusLab - Hazem Hesham,Approved,"ActivitiesThe internship at Salus Lab was a full-time remote internship. We worked 8 hours a day and 5days per week. In the beginning of every week, we would have a meeting to talk about ourprogress and any difficulties we faced, get assigned new tasks, and give feedback. I worked as aFull Stack developer and every task was assigned to two people. My teammate was also a fullstack intern so, for every task, we divided the backend and frontend between the both of us sothat we can get to work on both aspects of the task. We would then coordinate our page withother pages worked on by other team members so that we can have a fully functioning module.In this internship, I used Visual Studio Code IDE for writing code. The companyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢s stackconsisted of using Node.js, Fastify, and Elasticsearch for the backend, MongoDB for databases,Redis for caching, Vue.js for the frontend, and Docker. To organize and keep track of tasks, weused Trello and communicated through Discord. Finally, for source control, we used GitHub.Figure 2: Example of the task organization on Trello. [2]In the first week, I was tasked with setting up the project and the database on my computer. Thistook a while as it was my first time using Docker, which the whole project was built upon. Forthe second task, I had to design an API to retrieve security data and implement searching logicfor a table with a search functionality. For the data, we were using a public API and onlytweaking the input and output to suit our needs. The challenging part of this task was toimplement the searching algorithm. The data returned was a lot and took a long time to searchwhen few filters were chosen. To overcome this limitation, I used Redis to cache search resultsthat are frequently requested. This increased the efficiency and speed of the search dramatically.For the frontend task, we had to mimic the design made by our UI/UX designer on Figma. Thedesign consisted of a pie chart with a legend, rounded rectangles with data inside them, and atable with a search bar [Figure 3]. My task in the frontend was to make this table and connectthe search bar with the search logic that I did in the backend. For the table, I used the VuetifyFramework and built upon the already implemented table by adding more columns as needed,pagination, and a search bar [Figure 4]. I also added a dropdown for the search bar to selectcertain filters [Figure 5] as well as pills under the search bar to show the currently selected filters[Figure 6].Figure 3: The design of the page for the first task.Figure 4: Table and search bar.Figure 5: Drop down menuFigure 6: Pills under search bar.For my next task, I designed an API that would store IP addresses and another one that wouldretrieve them. I used MongoDB to store any newly entered IP addresses and validated that anewly added IP address doesnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢t already exist in the database. For the frontend, I used a similartable as in Figure 3 to show the retrieved IP addresses. Moreover, I made a form with twotextboxes to enter a nodeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢s IP address as well as its name [Figure 6]. I also added validation tomake sure the IP address was a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.Figure 6: Input fields for adding a node.My fourth task was fully backend. I was responsible for setting up the usage of a public APIfrom scratch. My task included setting up the API key and then making several different APIÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢sthat would use the public API. I then had to coordinate my work with my teammate who wasworking on the frontend. Luckily enough, it went smoothly and we were able to finish the task inless than a week. For my final task, I had to implement a search functionality using the searchengine, Elasticsearch. This task was a little difficult as it required a lot of research to understandhow to set up Elasticsearch, how the queries were formulated, and how to parse the returnedresult.Internship "
Hoda Ahmed Mostafa Desouki 49-14142 - Hoda Ahmed,Approved," I had two tasks to perform, the first one was a collaborative work on  enhancing the E/E Architecture of the smart E-Bike and the second one is to provide a solution  to the path planning problem which is basically planning how the bike will maneuver from point  A to point B without hitting obstacles  E/E Architecture: I worked along with my colleagues to provide an enhancement to the  already implemented system. The old Architecture had many drawbacks such as  1.  2 3. 4  The wires can get tangled and interchanged  The wires can be abruptly disconnected which can lead to accidents  It's very hard to trace back the wires for debugging  Using long wires adds extra clutter to the system. In addition, long signal wires results in high resistance compared to shorter ones.  It is hard for the user to ride the bike with all the mounted parts exposed  All of the above-mentioned drawbacks were solved by the following modification steps  (kindly check appendix at the end of this report for pictures comparing the E-Bike status  before and after the modifications):  1. Shortening the long wires by cutting them and welding  2. Replacing the throttle signal wire with a shorter one  3. Mounting the components on the triangular wood piece  4. Covering up the components using a similar triangular wood piece 5  Covering up the external wires with a coiled cable management sleeve  Furthermore, we designed some explanatory diagrams for the new Architecture: An E/E Architecture schematic, an E/E Architecture module and a fritzing simulation of the hardware  components (kindly check the appendix)  e My second task was to provide a path-planning algorithm that is not computationally heavy in order to have a real-time response. I have introduced the RRT Algorithm as a candidate to implement on the bike and simulated its performance using Pygame (a  python library)  "

HossamMagdyMohamedElHattab46_2935 - hossam magdy,Approved,"Tasks:  For the first task, it is about having to get a bank dataset and predict if the customer will leave or stay in the bank based on the previous recorded data. It required to describe data, then preprocessing it, then visualize it, then train model, evaluation and testing. So, I solved the task by getting a dataset with customers data in bank (age, has card or not, is current in bank or not) and the features of the customers then get profile report to get all characteristics of the data then get the statistics of every variable then get the correlation between every variable with each other to see if they affect the output so that if 2 independent variables have same importance on target then we drop one of them, in correlation, the ones that have most impact have a value closest to 1. Then afterwards obtain the missing values of the dataset then see if there is any duplicates in the dataset so I obtain the max number of duplicates which results in 0 then check if there is any null values. Afterwards unused columns are dropped as they are features that have no significance in correlation. Then visualize data by having the variable compare to each other in Histogram and Pie Chart then preprocess the data by changing value in variables from character to number (like true/false , Male/Female,...etc. to 1/0) where it changed every country into having its own column and if customer is in it then it's value there will be 1 and all 4 Student Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt        other will be 0.Afterwards I train the model by train-test-split on an element so that we can test model on a separate data that model hasn't seen. Using columns not to values 0 or 1s  to show normal distribution, then balance data by class weight by having a small part of data have a high importance weight and have model be Sequential and have gradient decent with the reason to have better testing for the output and decrease error. Finally, we test model and get the prediction and record the accuracy, prediction and recall then draw the RDC graph.  For the second Task, it was to get all ATMs of Banque Misr and display them in a dashboard. I worked in a team where we got the data of all Bank Misr ATMs by web scrapping using Instant Data Scraper (chrome extension)the About Us page in Bank Misr where it hosted the locations of the ATMs then we exported them into excel where it had the entire address in google map URL format with the Latitude and Longitude then we checked if the data is accurate on the google map. Then we separated the Latitude and Longitude from the URL and put them in separate columns by using Text to column in Excel. Then by using Python, and importing the required libraries(geopandas) and excel sheet, after that we read the shape files by using the geopandas, then check for null values to drop then we plot the polygon in shapefile in a geometry then we find the polygon that contains each point then we put them into a list with the names of the columns that we will use, then we check the points inside the geometry with that of the polygon , and if it matches ,we put the data in the suitable list and if it doesn't match , null is putted onto the list with their index in a variable to be dropped afterwards. Then we put values in the list into columns then we export the data into an excel sheet to be used as in a dashboard which we used PowerBI to visualize and display the Dashboard where we imported the final excel sheet into PowerBI then having filters and slices to separate the data and putting it on a map to display and visualize the ATMs of Banque Misr in Egypt.  For the third task, It was a task to get the closest ATM for every specific ATM and show it on a dashboard , using the sheet from task2 and a formula taken from the internet (Haversine formula) , me and my team were able to get for each ATM the closest and 2nd closest and 3rd closest ATM by getting the distance in KM then sorting it then only taking the least 3 distances corresponding ATM then we turn the distances into meters and put them into columns then export it into excel. Afterward we showed and visualized the data in a dashboard using PowerBI where we imported the excel sheet into then separating the data by filters and slices then putting it on a main map to display all ATMs then we made another map to display the ATM that is closest to the ATM on the main map then we made a 3rd map to display the ATM that is the 2nd closest to the ATM on the main map with labels of their distance.

ilovepdf_merged (1) (4) - Ahmed Azooz 49-18699,Approved,"TasksMonth 1:The internship started with a meeting with the stakeholders to lay the grounds of theautomatic defense scheduling system. Constraints were discussed and the basic skeleton ofthe system was agreed upon. We started researching different algorithms to use to solve theproblem and after many meetings with my teammates we decided to use The GeneticAlgorithm with Shotgun-Hill Climbing.Month 2:The implementation of the algorithm started in month 2. The Algorithm contains somecomponents like solution representation, cost function and neighboring algorithm. So Istarted to represent the solution using python. The solution was represented as an array ofsize of the amount of slots. Each cell contained information about the assignment (Examiner,Supervisor and Student). Then I started to implement the cost function. The cost functioncalculates how much this solution costs. The lower the cost the better the solution is. Inmonth 2 the cost function  only calculates if the same examiner/supervisor is present in thesame slot more than two times.Month 3 and the remaining two weeks:Further advancements on the algorithm took place in month 3. Some Greedy Algorithmaspects were added into the algorithm. The cost function was also modified to account forcontinuity of slots and the number of working days an examiner has per schedule. As theconstraints given by the coordinators was that The Examiner should have continuous slotsand he should have no more than two working days per schedule.2Internship "

I got my own tasks which were mostly front-end related (designing pages and creating Physical Components to be used in the ncr builder). I had a couple of backend tasks related to parsing and decoding bank messages received from the bank and customizing the functions available on the software according to the capabilities of the atm machine. As I have never learned Angular JS in any of my courses at the university till now, most of my work was self learning and research. "

Two designs were proposed and voting was made to choose the final design that will be used in the website. Then the team designed the database schema and created the tables in the MDF. Week 1:  During the 1st week, the team was divided into 2 groups. Each group was responsible for designing a template for the homepage using Figma with their custom color palette. I was responsible for choosing the color palette and implementing parts of the homepage (Header, Footer, Announcements, etc.). Then, voting was made along the team members and the best design and color palette were chosen to be implemented for the website. The rest of the pages were then divided among the teams and I was responsible for designing the Alumni Honors and Published papers, adjusting the icons in the sidebar to be consistent on all pages, and designing the student activities page. Week 2:  During the 2nd week, a new design was introduced by one of my colleagues and we were divided into three teams among the new and old design and a testing team to prepare a questionnaire. I was on the team responsible for finalizing the old design. I was responsible for editing the course details section with its prototypes and hierarchy, the staff hierarchy, and finalizing its prototypes and All the prototypes from and to the home page.  Week 3: During the 3rd week, we started searching for resources about how to implement MDF in order to start designing the database and I was also responsible for finalizing the new design after it was chosen by the results of the questionnaire. Week 4: During the 4th week, I was part of the team responsible for designing the database schema where each one contributed his understanding of the tables that should be implemented, attributes, and the different relations between them, and communicating with the supervisor to update the schema taking into consideration her suggestions too.

Maged George Saied 46-2066 - CaptainMaged 77,Reject,"The report mentions the following information about the performed tasks during the internship at Sarana jewelry:1. The main project of the internship was implementing a cross-platform mobile application for Sarana jewelry.2. The application aimed to sell Sarana's jewelry and had a premium feature of displaying the pieces of jewelry as a 3D model.3. The application was implemented using Flutter and Dart.4. The interns researched how to use Flutter and Dart to implement the application and how to import 3D models into it.5. Initially, Xamarin, C#, and XML were learned and researched, but Flutter was chosen due to the lack of successful 3D model importing libraries in Xamarin.6. The resulting application had three main pages: home page, product page, and 3D model page.7. The interns learned technical skills such as implementing a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter and Dart and displaying a 3D model using the Babylon library.8. Soft skills learned during the internship include working in a team, reporting to the supervisor, and research skills.9.

Mariam Hesham Aly 46-4708 - Mariam Salem,Approved,"Activities: ISM (Information storage and management) version 4 was the programme I was learning for my internship. To start with, I was given a brief overview of the ISM modules and subjects. The subjects I studied included (Cloud computing, Big data analysis, Internet of things, Machine Learning, compute and desktop virtualization, storage and network, Software defined data centre (SDDC), RAID techniques in intelligent storage systems), after which I was given tasks for each module. I first read in-depth about each topic and thoroughly studied its concepts and applications, and then I was given a 60-minute evaluation by my monitor. The practical part was to apply a small simulation of that topic, for example, in the machine learning module, I implemented a machine learning model using regression to predict sales of a product. I also simulated a desktop virtualization. So, the instructor starts the day by checking what I did in the last day to evaluate me and give me the next task to cover theoretically and practically.   Internship Evaluation: Through this internship, I gained a variety of skills, such as how to conduct thorough research and extract relevant information about a given subject, fully comprehend the operation of storage systems, the network hierarchy from the end user to the server and all phases in between, as well as problem-solving, responsibility, and time management. Yes, this internship lived up to my expectations and motivated me to continue learning about these topics after I graduate. My GUC courses in networks, databases I and II, machine learning, embedded systems, and microprocessors were all connected to the internship tasks. I heartily endorse DELL TECHNOLOGY to all of my colleagues since it provides a wonderful opportunity to comprehend many of the technological fundamentals required in the job market.   Conclusion: In conclusion, I learned a lot while working as an intern at DELL Technology. I was successful in developing a machine learning model that predicts the product sales. I learned several things, but the most important ones are my research and time management skills. while I was an intern. I applied the skills and knowledge I gained from my GUC lecturers during my internship. The best and most advantageous features are being more familiar with the job market and how things operate there.

Mariam Mohamed Nabil 46-0733 - Farah Walid,Approved,"Tasks :  I was assigned along with a group of my colleagues to a project which was working on a flight optimization system .The optimization algorithm itself was written  by another company and integrated with us and all we had to do was to build a web platform where the users can enter their inputs. For the first part of my internship I had to get familiar with the platform we were going to use which was Laravel as well the language which was PHP, as it was my first time working with them . I had to watch online tutorials in addition to the suggested course links that were provided to us by the company itself.  After finishing my research , I started working on the task I was assigned to, which was in the backend part of the web platform. First and foremost , they gave us information about all the tables along with their properties , and each team member working on this task was assigned a group of tables to handle. I began by using MySQL in order to create those tables in the database along with all their corresponding attributes ; I created every table and entered its attributes , specified their types , and also specified all the foreign keys and primary keys. After I was done with creating the tables in the database , I was supposed to create a Model class for each table along with a Controller class and a Router class which included the routes . I created the simple get , post , update , delete and restore methods . I learnt from them a new way of handling a delete method , ,as instead of permanently deleting the record, they just hid it in order to facilitate the restoring method , should we like to restore that record. After building my APIs , I tested whether they were working correctly or not by using Postman.  As for how my working day looked like , I spent my day attending SCRUM meetings, then discussing with my colleagues the task that should be done within that day , then working on that task , and at the end of the day I submitted my work on Bitbucket in order for it to be integrated with my colleaguesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢ work.

The internship was 4 weeks, with an online meeting with Dr. Hassan Soubra every Tuesday at 12:00 pm, and sometimes we needed an extra meeting which was on Thursday, my colleague Farah Afifi helped me with the research and making the references for the papers we used. She took a certain type of trojan and worked with it which was sequential, while I took the combination.  My working day was 5-hour working including research, writing code and building a circuit. I used Logisim, Logisim evolution, Quartus Prime 20.1 and an FPGA Board. The research was the hardest phase of the internship for me because at the beginning I was using the wrong keywords to find good and relevant papers to get the information from but then I was able to find really good papers when I changed the keywords as Dr. Soubra told me to do and with the help from Farah.          3.

Mario Ayman Michel 46-0978 - Mario Abdelmalek,Approved,"Tasks: The daily schedule was a regular 9 to 5, starting with organizing the to-do list for the day. Then, a small lunch break with the team at 2pm before finally leaving the office at 5pm. Going into more details, the internship was divided into 2 main chunks or milestones. The first milestone was mainly an education opportunity, where I was taught several frameworks to kickstart the second milestone seamlessly. The education process was undergone in the form of application on the backend of a mini website, using C# as the language, that was apparent only to the internal users in the organization. To begin with, in the first milestone I learned the basics of creating web APIs using ASP.NET Core for the backend. In addition, I was enlightened by PostgreSQL database, that was connected by the backend. The large database included 3 tables, first containing the stocks, second containing clients and the third containing stock orders that were done by the clients.  Regarding the frontend, I learned the usage of AngularJS to be able to create and design login and registration pages. Additionally, I was able to build a page that conveyed the prices of stocks, that also changed and updated without the need to refresh the page. Moreover, I created a page that connected the abovementioned 3 tables in order to view the customersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢ names with the orders they made and the prices of stocks ordered.  Regarding the automatic price update of the stocks, I used SignalR in the frontend and backend. In the ASP.NET Core (backend), I created a Hub named Market Change to which the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ…â€œupdate stock pricesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â service in the frontend is connected to. Moving to the frontend, I created this ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ…â€œupdate stock pricesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â service connecting it to the Market Change Hub in the backend. Thus, every 5 seconds the newly updated stock prices in the database are sent from the backend to the frontend without refreshing the page.  For the second milestone, I created a project for the internal users of EGID that was able to visualize what the clients of the firm owned from virtual machines and clusters. ASP.NET Core was also used for the backend and AngularJS for the frontend. I was able to make it visual to EGIDÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢s internal users how much CPU cores and remaining storage is left inside the clusters and how much each virtual machine is occupying inside a node.  Regarding authentication and authorization, I used JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication to protect the ASP.NET Core API. This was done to provide access to various functionality of the application. The admin has a separate authority, where one can do something, unlike the authority of the user.  "
Marise Fahim Tadros 46-1035 - Maryse Fahim,Approved,"tasks:Before beginning the internship activities, we had a look at the various webdevelopment frameworks and when each one should be used. In order to introduce us to theworld of software development, which demands the mastery of problem-solving techniques,we also conducted problem-solving exercises.The following phase involved choosing the framework for a web development projectthat had been assigned to us. We chose to utilise strapi for the backend and next js for thefrontend.I was working on two tasks simultaneously because it was my first time to use strapi: Iwas learning strapi and conducting research while analysing the database to determine theentities and the relationships among them. During this phase I was seeing the practical use ofthe database course that we studied in semester 5 and put it to use. We also had regularmeetings with the team working on the frontend to share our progress together.Later on, after I had learned more about strapi and had a good understanding of thedatabase, my task was to create the tables using strapi and add the attributes. The crucial stepthat connects the frontend and backendÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Âand ultimately ties everything togetherÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Âcame next.Internship "

Most of the tasks I performed were related to those services along with same databases manipulation (MySQL) if needed for the tasks. Java is the programming language that we used in most of the courses here at the university so this give me a head start in the internship and give me enough time to focus on having a profound understanding of the assigned tasks. I worked with a team were each member had a specific task to perform under the supervision of a senior developer, who coordinate between the different tasks and assign each part to a developer and to which we report back when we end the assigned task or face a certain problem.

May Magdy Hussien 46-5830 - May Hussien,Approved,"Tasks:  During the internship we were working in teams where each team was responsible for a certain task and then we integrated the different parts together. The aim of the project was to be able to remotely drive the self-driven car (SDC) from the VR lab using the virtual reality headset. First, I was part of the team that was working on displaying the camera feed in virtual reality. So we had to search and explore how we can use unity, a cross-platform game engine, developed to display the feed in VR. After some work, we managed to find a way to capture the computer screen and display it in unity to be later shown in VR. Then, we joined the team that was working on establishing a communication between the SDC and the PC in the VR lab to help explore the different possible ways we can send and receive the camera feed along with the other controls needed for the car orientation and movement. After managing to establish the needed communication and locally test all the features integrated together. We tried the prototype to evaluate its performance and see where we have a room for improvement for the next model. In the second phase our main goal was to improve the quality of the communication by working on reducing the delay. Also we wanted to improve the overall quality of the users experience so we added a back camera, wide angle camera (to help have a better view of the sidewalks) and finally we added distance leaders, used to warn the user if anything is approaching from a blind spot not covered by the cameras. Also we made some improvement on the user interface to account for the new added features and make the interface more user friendly .To make the users have a more realistic experience we 1 Student Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt        worked alongside with a team of mechatronics students that were developing haptic gloves that have different levels of vibration that help the user have a feedback on the road he is currently driving on and a taste of the surrounding environment.

Every Sunday, I participated in the sprint planning  session where the team got together to divide user stories into smaller tasks, give time estimates on how long  these tasks will take, and add these tasks to the sprint backlog. The Backend project followed Microservices  architecture, that's why I used various different frameworks and technologies, which were NodeJs (Express),  MongoDB, Golang, PostgreSQL, NATS, and Docker. Most of the tasks I had were to develop and add new  endpoints to the API using Nodejs/Golang with the needed authentication, authorization, and validations that  meet the business requirements. Then, after creating the endpoint, I needed to implement unit and integration  tests using Jest and  Mocha, and I also needed to write documentation(docs) for the new endpoint using  Swagger. Other tasks I had were to fix bugs in the system reported either by the Testing team or users while  using the system. Also, some tasks were to introduce third-party software (e.g NATS, AWS S3) to the system  which was done by setting up the configuration for the Software Development kit (SDK), and editing the  Dockerfile if needed. There were also some tasks to refactor a service or a unit test by breaking it into smaller  functions that can be used in more than one service or test.

Mohamed Osama Yehya Osman 49-10995 - Mohamed Osama,Approved,"Tasks:  During the first week of the internship I got a tour of the data center and was  given an overview of the services offered and the technologies used. I was briefly introduced to the hardware  components of servers. I learned about a variety of storage techniques (e.g. block storage and object storage)  and the differences between them. In addition, I got the chance to see the components of a server and all the  connections that connect the shared storages with the actual servers through network file share. By the end of  the week, I got the chance to help in the memory upgrade of one of the servers and the setup of the remote  access for the terminal of another one.  4  Student Career & Alumni Development Office.  scad@guc.edu.eg  | German University in Cairo  New Cairo City - Main  Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt  The next month I learned about Virtualization - using VMWare specifically - and got the chance to work on  their staging environment. I started by creating a VSPhere for creating a single server to learn and have a better  understanding of the software; I created multiple virtual machines with different resources and limitations  which had a variety of Operating systems (Linux, windows server and ubuntu to list a few) I set the all the  different components for each of them and setup the connections to the network and gave each of them different  storage tier by changing the IOPs for each of them to simulate different storage technologies. After that, I  started creating resource groups to represent companies and assigning each of them a virtual data center to  allow the customers the ability to customize their virtual machines based on their needs - this allowed me to  start testing virtual machines with expandable resources which can take the needed memory or storage based on  the needs of each machine from the resource pool. The third week I spent creating multiple VSpheres to  simulate an environment and then creating a VCenter - there was one in place but it needed an upgrade so I  created a new one and turned the old one off - with the supervision of one of the employees. This allowed for  the setup of a load balancer and  enabled the high availability feature which allows VMs to turn on  automatically on a different server in case the one they are on fails. Later I started learning and working with  other VMWare products like VRealize Operations and VRealize Network Insight which are monitoring tools  which can be integrated with VCenter through APIs to allow for the easy and automated process of creating  reports and having a detailed vision of all the traffic and resources being utilized in order to fix any potential  problems before they arise and allow the customers the ability to see how their resources are being utilized to  make informed decisions about their environment.  The following week I didnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢t have any tasks to perform but I spent the first 3 days shadowing the networks team  in which I learned about all different network cards and how VPNs and they set up SSL tunnels for customers  that have sensitive data. The last 2 days I spent with the security team learning about different testing techniques  and potential vulnerabilities that might put the company at risk - I also was shown how penetration testing  works. While I didnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€žÂ¢t have any tasks to do this week, I believe that it allowed me to have a better understanding  of the necessity of all these components and how any team not being able to perform their  tasks correctly can  compromise the whole environment.  The last month of the internship I spent learning about system administration and linux. I successfully  completed all the components of Red Hat Admin 1 course in which I started by learning about the command  line and managing files through it ( by restricting access and learning about the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy). In  addition I  learned about groups and users and granting them access. I then started learning about Linux  processes, services and Daemons ,and packages. Afterwards I learned about analyzing and storing logs, and  5  Student Career & Alumni Development Office.  scad@guc.edu.eg  | German University in Cairo  New Cairo City - Main  Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt  archiving and transferring files.

We first outlined our problem to start with and then tried to come up with machine learning solutions to solve that problem which was that testing and weights testing for software is a very tedious task so we want to use machine learning to have an agent do it on its own. At the beginning of any problem that you are trying to solve, you should complete your learning on the topic and then do your research on that problem. So indeed these were the first two tasks assigned to me. After the learning phase we go on to designing the architecture phase and then the implementation phase so I was given many tasks that constantly gets me thinking on how to create/implement it. As for the working conditions, the company has a flexible policy meaning that you can work from home or from the office or hybrid it's your choice but I chose to work from the office as I found it more productive and convent to socialize and make connections. The team I worked in is extremely sociable and competitive thus every Thursday they organized a pade| competition which I always participated in. But as for the rest of the week, my normal working day would be that I arrive at the office and work for 8 hours and during lunch time we order food and the entire team sits together to socialize. The working tools I used were python as programming language alongside machine learning techniques, Linux command line, and lastly verification and coverage tools. As previously mentioned, a huge part of the internship was research as it was still w new idea that should still be implemented to first they provided learning resources to get familiar with the topic, then they provided a research paper that we should take as inspiration and we dissected it.

The first task was to extract 100 audios using Audacity where the sampling rate had to be 44100 and each audio had to range from | to 9 second long and this task was weekly as each participant had to make a total of 400-500 audios at the end of the internship. We used the ""Hya and Da Vinci"" series to extract those audios and we were given 6 emotion to choose from that were Neutral, Happy, Sad, Fearful, Angry and Surprised. Each week every one of us was given 5 episodes to extract the audios and we were given a datasheet that had some columns, one was for the name of the audios that consisted of the speaker ID and the emotion of the audio and a number for how many times that audio got repeated. The 2nd column was for the speaker ID that was the name of the actor, the 3rd column was for the gender, the 4th was for the age group, the Sth was for Main label that was the emotion that the participant that extracted the audios thinks that is the suitable one, the 6th was for the series name and there were another 4 columns and they were for the other 2 participants to enter their name and the emotion they think is suitable for that one audio.  The second week, we had to do another task beside the extracting audios task, where it was a coding task done using Python programming language and Google Colab Editor and basically we had to do some statistics on the datasheet for example how many female/male audios, the number of each emotion, the number of audios for one actor which is the number of speaker ID and the number of each group age.

The tasks performed was almost the same throughout both products. My typical work day would start off with the daily scrum meeting, where every member of the team would tell us what they did yesterday, what they will do today and if there was any blockers they faced.  Right after the daily scrum, if any blockers needed the input of the Product Owner, I would attend the meeting with the developer/tester/tech lead/scrum master and the Product Owner (my mentor). Usually after these meetings I am assigned some epics or features to define user stories for them (write the actual user story, define the DOD(Definition Of Done) and the Acceptance Criteria for the story). Since I have spent nearly two weeks with each product, I have attended sprint refinement meetings, sprint planning meetings and finally sprint retrospective meetings. I was also assigned to perform UAT (User Acceptance Tests) to declare a user story done. I have also led a meeting with a UX/UI designer to discuss how to implement a specific feature to make sure it meets the business requirement behind it and write accurate user stories for it. I have also completed courses in using JIRA and Confluence, which helped me while using them to manage the sprints, user stories and enablers. Lastly throughout the 30 days of the internship, I researched, prepared slides and presented more than ten presentations with different topics. These topics mainly were about Product Owner and Product Manager different types and roles, the different Agile methodologies specially the scrum methodology and so much more topics. I have also learned so much about the software industry and how things actually work inside big tech companies like VOIS, I have also gained so much experience not only technically with writing the user stories and defining the definition of done and the acceptance criteria and all of the experience mentioned above, but I have also gained experience with dealing with people and I can definitely feel so much improvement in my interpersonal skills. The internship with VOIS surprisingly exceeded my expectations.  "

First, we had 3 sessions in database architecture and how to create a master data, then we learned how to use Knime tool and solved a couple of exercises with it. Then we had a training in data analytics and creating dashboards with powerBi and I created a full dashboard to practice what I have learned. Lastly, Mr. Ahmed Ghaly (Head of Project Management and Technology Consulting) gave us an instructive Project Management training that I learned about scope definition, risk management, scrum methodology, project communication plan and how to set a project timeline. Also, I had a task to write a charter. In the third week we started working on the project. We followed agile scrum methodology throughout the 6 weeks. We had Mr. Mohamed Samy as our scrum master, who guided us through everything in the project. Also, we had a weekly meeting with Mr. Neal Afifi (The Managing Director) to keep track or our progress in the project. Furthermore, we attended meetings with potential customers who are interested in purchasing this tool when it is completed. During the 6 weeks, we planned and created a database with its master data using SQL on Microsoft SQL server. Also, we used the web-scraper tool to scrape data on daily basis, then we would clean it using knime and excel formulas. This was a very challenging part as we would encounter daily different problem in the collected data so we had to find ways to solve it. Then we would take the data we cleaned and display it in dashboards using powerbi. "

Some of the constraints ranged fromnumber of days, number of slots, number of rooms, gaps, minimum andmaximum slots for the external examiner,and external examiner takingonly one room per day. Then we started researching to find the mostcompatible algorithm for these constraints and for the schedulingprocess itself.At the end of the month we were torn between using theGenetic Algorithm with Shotgun-Hill Climbing or a Greedy Algorithm.The Second Month:At the start of the second month, we divided the team into two.Each testing one type of algorithm and after evaluating the speed,theefficiency, and the correctness of the solution itself we decided onusing the Genetic Algorithm with Shotgun-Hill Climbing. Some of themain aspects of the Genetic Algorithm include the cost function,neighboring function, the algorithm, the way the input and output iscreated and generated. Moreover, we decided to create a website thatmakes it easier for the coordinators to insert and manipulate thedata through a nice looking front-end. I took the task ofimplementing the neighboring algorithm, which decides which slots toswitch and when.Also keeping the cost that was generated from thecost function to a minimum and trying to decrease it.The Third Month (with the remaining two weeks):In the last month, I kept on editing the neighboring algorithmadding slot candidates and also incorporating some greediness intothe algorithm due to the amount of constraints that were more complexthan expected. Moreover, after the final meeting with thecoordinators I changed some of the algorithm from their feedback.Ialso fixed some of the front-end colors and input ways to be easierto the coordinators.Internship"

This internship was called Egyptian Arabic Speech Recognition Dataset, and my role in it was as a supervisor. It was a remote internship which means we communicated through communication platforms such as Zoom and WhatsApp. I also collaborated with the supervisors on creating the website through Github. The goal of this internship was to build an Egyptian Arabic Speech Recognition Dataset from scratch so it can be used to train and test a Sentiment Analysis Machine Learning Algorithm. This algorithm is meant to decide what emotion the speaker is feeling upon being fed an audio of their speech. I was assigned to supervise 3 groups of a total of 12 students whose main task was to produce this dataset by recording audio files from Egyptian TV shows alongside with developing a few programming tasks. I would choose the shows, assign one to each group and give them a deadline. Then I check up on their work and perform several data organization programs. The final step of this cycle is performing data augmentation techniques on the data to increase and improve it. Parallel to this cycle, I was working on the website developed using MERN stack which we, the supervisors and I, have divided into 3 parts so each can work on a page full-stack; backend, databases and frontend.

In order to achieve that we used the famous game developing platform unity to make a virtual environment starts with a basic home with 2 rooms and try to train our model using python language to move every item we used in the entire 3D environment to reach the final design of a specific room based o n famous furniture standards.  So, our project was divided into 4 phases; The first 2 weeks I had to make a research on the machine learning algorithms try to understand the basics of neural networks in addition to how to use CNNs for training a model to pe rform a specific task on Object detection not only on the furniture but generally to be able to deal with a pre -coded neural network. After sharing the research with the team by a presentation I had to learn how to work on the 3d environment and 3d objects  using unity engine so, this process took a long time; I started with small games to know how to deal with unity assets  and prefabs and the I took my work to the next level to learn how to use the predefined machine learning agent of unity to make a simple  trained model of the 3d object. Related to the furniture work we used 3d models of basic pieces of furniture to use in a small design of a home.  In unity the running script was displaying the room and some 3d objects of furniture pieces and our algorithm has to systemize those pieces in terms of the standards of the furniture or sometimes on the choice of the user.     5 Student Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt    The last image is an example of the view of the room and a 3d model of a chair. After running the script the ML agent uses the functionalit y of moving to move that chair around the room and calculates a score to reach the most suitable place of that chair. So, the more acceptable place of the piece the higher value of the score.  The final interface of this process is a view of the room with t he added furniture item and every furniture item placed in the right place with the highest possible score. The last 4 weeks I had to understand the Django and .net frame work to develop a website that uses images of the furniture items and output the 3d m odel of these items and then I had to add a script for that new item to help the training model in calculating the score while working with this item into our environment on unity engine. Finally the webpage created views options of the furniture item to m ake a choice of the 3d objects that will be used in the unity engine and the script will be applied on it.     "

They needed a toolthat allows them to summarise documents and articles usingAgoloÃ¢Â€Â™ s NLP  summarization model through a web interface. Thiswas meant to summarise the companiesÃ¢Â€Â™  documents or any textthat they would input for the on-demand Agolo summariser .My role was to work on the front end side of the project to integrateit with the API of AgoloÃ¢Â€Â™ s on-demand summariser , which was writtenin ExpressJS and SpringJS.I was working on a ReactJS application that provides the user witha configurable interface that, given an article, will summarise it tothe type of summary the user selected. W e had 3 types ofsummaries:1.Bullet points summary ,which consists of a numberofmain points that are the core summary of the article, andthat number is configurable (defaults to 5 bullet pointsand max 20).2.Coherent summary ,which is a summary for users thatare more interested in a small, well-written, andconstructive paragraph that represents the articlesummary . The number of words was also configurable(the default was 100 and the max was 500).3.Speakable summary ,this is a summary for usersinterested in an audio version, which is also playablethrough the website using an API that generates anaudio for the summary using the Azure text-to-speechservice.User stories go as follows:1.The user would input the article's URL  or the actual text.a.In case the article is inputted as a URL, AgoloÃ¢Â€Â™ s backendwill take care of scrapping the article and extracting thetext from it.2.The user chooses the type of the summary (coherent, bulletpoint or speakable) using a radio group.3.The user will customise the configuration for each type, likethe number of bullet points in the case of the bullet pointsummary or the number of words in the case of the coherent,using a number-formatted input form.4.The user will then click ""summarise"", which will initiate an APIPOST  request to the right AgoloÃ¢Â€Â™ s summarization endpointthat will return a body consisting of the summary and someextra data like the number of bullets or words.5.Finally , in the case of the speakable summary , the user isallowed to click ""generate audio,"" which will make anotherPOST  request API call to AgoloÃ¢Â€Â™ s text-to-speech using anAzure endpoint that will return playable audio, and the userwill be able to play/pause/resume the audio.Things we planned as future work:1.The ability for the user to edit the returned summary2.The ability for the user to save/delete summaries (whichrequired authentication that wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t ready yet on the back end)3.The ability for the user to choose between dif ferent voices inthe speakable summary4.

This included creating surveys to ask manufacturers and healthcare  providing institutions about their current systems and their expectations from a new system. I worked with my team on creating the  questions and collecting contacts of possible stakeholders that we may gain information from. We collected our results and  brainstormed to get concrete requirements and design the system. The next phase was creating the database which we did over a  few iterations to ensure all requirements are correctly satisfied and there are not redundancies and the provider used was MS SQL  Server. During the later phases of DB design, we also started prototyping. After the initial design with the requirements, DB and  layout were set, we started working on the implementation which used ASP.NET with C# to create the backend and HTML/CSS to  create the frontend.

Numerousprogramming languages are used to create web-based applications. Some of them are just utilized for thesoftware's frontend and backend design. HTML3, HTML4, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, etc.are a few examples. Additionally , certain other programming languages are employed in the creation ofthe software or application's dynamic features. For instance, Java, PHP , etc. There are now someframeworks that are widely used. Frameworks use Model, View, and Controller to implement structuredprogramming. MVC is another name for it.

(A) Ziad_Amr_Darwish_37_2496 - Ayy Lmao (1),Approved,"tasks within the internship varied weekly depending on what problems were reported within the ticket system.  Some of these problems would require the update of the servers. In that case, my colleagues and I, under the supervision of the lead engineer, would evaluate the problem and follow the lead of the supervisor in either updating the system or fixing it manua lly. Other problems that we would fix would be IT problems like fixing devices (laptops, printers, barcode readers...etc.) within the factory. The biggest task I had was setting up barcode readers. These barcode readers would make tracking the shipments ar riving to the factory easier. The old system required workers to manually write down the shipment that arrived, and the data surrounding it. The new system made things faster, workers would just scan the barcode and register the shipment. This would be ext remely faster. This required us to manually set up these devices using .Net and a C++ editor. The job wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t done after setting them up as we had to orient the workers on how to use them. Another task we did was fix old devices that the company didnÃ¢Â€Â™t need . As companies made profit out of them. We wiped all devices and exchanged working parts within similar devices and made sure they ran correctly.  Routine  My day would start by driving to the factory to the 10th of Ramadan city, I would arrive at 9. Check the ticket system. Deal with any ongoing problems. Some of these problems would require us to visit the factory and other departments. Then leave at 4 pm.  As for unusual trips, the first week I was oriented on some concepts regarding networks and client s erver concepts which we would utilize later. Another unusual trip was a trip around the factory, we visited working stations and places where blue collar workers would work. This helped us understand their perception to dealing with electronic devices. We used .Net, windows deployment services, visual studio and boot services. As well as, physical tools to set up LAN cables and deal with computer hardware.

TASKS PERFORMED (A) Maryam Khaled,Approved,"Tasks Performed:  
This section includes:  
1. Brief intr oduction on previous work  
2. Overview of how we used the MERN stack  
3. Tasks performed which include : 
i. Frontend – compon ents used along with t heir pictures  ii. Conn ecting the front end to the backend  
iii. Deployment  
 
1. Brief introduction on previous work  
This internship opportunity was a continuation of previous work done by students  who managed 
to collect  a dataset with features about Arabic movies from the 40s to the 70s from a website 
called elcinema.com . They analyzed  features relevant to cast members and trends of stardom and 
cast correlations over time, and analyzed the plots themselves for word usage and plot themes 
and how they evolved over time .  
2. Overvi ew of  how we used the MERN stack  
We achieved our work using the MERN sta ck, which is an architecture that all ows you to 
construct a 3 -tier ar chitecture (frontend, backend, database)  using JavaScript and JSON . We used 
React.js to build up the  following components, and we used Mon goDB database for storing data 
for later retrie val and Express. js framework  and Node.js server for URL routing and handli ng 
HTTP requests and responses. By making GET and POST request from th e front end, we 
connected to Expres s.js functio ns which powered our application .  
We used Visual Studio Code in order to implement ou r appli cation  
 
3. Tasks Performed  
The main task that I was enrolled  in in this internship was creating  the frontend of  the website to 
display the results of what was achieved  by the  Data Engineering tasks. This was achieved using 
the Reac t frontend li brary.   
Firstly , we started by discussing the structure as well as the design of our website . The website 
has various  features  and I will be discussing each feature  and how it was achieve d. For these 
features, we used Material UI, a comprehensive library of components that  features the 
implementation of Google’s Material Design system , and provides robust, customizable, and acces sible  foundational and advanced components, enabling you to build and design your system 
and develop React applications.  
When  we first open the website,  the home page is displayed, which contains  movie s, a login 
option, a signup option, and a search bar  as demonstrated below . 
 
I will be providing screenshots of the components  create d. 
i. Frontend  
1. The SignUp  Component  
The following screenshot shows what our SignUp component looks like. There are 6 
textfields for the user to fill in. The user can fill in their username, first name, last name, 
email address, password, and a password confirmation in order to sign up. When the user 
clicks on the SIGN UP button, their data will be stored in our database, and will be redirected 
to the login page as shown below.  
 
 
2. The Login  Component  
This component contains a textfield to enter your username, and another textfield to enter 
your password and then the log in button . If the user enters correct credentials , the data will 
be verified by the database and the user will be successfully logged in  and then will be 
redirected to the home page, indicating their username in the taskbar at the top . This is 
demonstrated below:  
 
If the user enters wrong data, they will also be notified  that the login failed, indicating that 
the username and password combination does not exist in the database  as shown below . 
 
 
3. The Search Bar Component  
 
This component allows the user to search for a certain movie . The user types in the name of 
the movie in t he search bar and the movie appears in the results.  
The following shows an example of searching for the movie """"ابن عنتر:  
 
And its result:  
 
 
 
4. The Button Group Component  
This is a responsive drawer that displays a button group when clicked on, and the button 
group shows all the genres of the movies from which the user can choose form , as displayed  
on the left  in the following:  
 
These are the resulting movies after clicking on """"دراما  button, as indicated by the / دراما in the 
URL  shown above:  
 
 
5. The Movie Card Component  
The user can click on any movie of preference and they will be redirected to a page that 
displays information about that movie. The information includes the movie’s nam e, its 
summary, its rating, its genre, the cast, its duration, its release date and starring.  
The following is an example illustrating what is mentioned above after clicking on the movie 
 """"النيل والحياة  : 
 
6. The Star Rating Component  
Moreover, the user can  rate the movie using a scale of 5 stars which they can find below the 
movie information  as shown above.  
 
The user can also delete their old ra ting and rate a gain according to their preference.  
ii. Connec ting the frontend to the backend  
To connect the fronten d to the backend, for each of the co mponents used above, we used Axios, 
a promised -based HTTP client for Java Script , and has the ability to make HTTP requests from 
the browser and handle the trans formation  of request and response data . We used axios.get(url) 
and axios.post( url) whenever we needed to retrieve an o bject using a promise and inside th at 
object is data that is then assigned to a certain value.  
iii. Deployment  
The backend part of our application was deployed using Heroku,  a Paa S that enab led us to build  
and run our appl ication ent irely in the cloud . 
The frontend part of our application was deployed using Netlify , also a tool used to develop and 
deplo y a Reac t project. We first installed some comm ands from Netlify on our terminal, then we 
used Netlify CL I to deploy our React  app, and then creating our website ’s domain name. "
