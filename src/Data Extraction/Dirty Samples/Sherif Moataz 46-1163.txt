 The internship was mainly tasked with being embedded with the different departments of the IT sector. Following now is the overview of the different departments  and the tasks performed with them.  -Database Administration/support: This department is responsible for the maintenance, testing and management of database resources. They work with a SQL engine, their responsibilities include querying for data as the main database has very limited access due to the sensitive nature of financial data. They also test any new updates to the database by first testing on simulated non-live clone of the database. They are also in charge of receiving the database metrics, and preemptively stopping the system in case of an imminent crash. Tasks performed by myself included querying for information, as well as receving talks on the meaning of the database metrics and the actions done to maintain the database, including the importance of backing up data.  -E-channels: This department was in charge of integration of online services with the bank’s core system.
