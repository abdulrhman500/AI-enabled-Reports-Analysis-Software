Their website is https://iotblue.com/ .Throughout the internship I was with the backend team and was assigned by my supervisordifferent tasks in distinct projects according to the sprint. A task may take about several daysor weeks accordingly, so every working day I would spend my hours in the office doing partof the task and upon finishing the task I do a pull request for my branch on bitbucket to havemy task reviewed and merged by my supervisor. Considering the tasks assigned to me, as astart I had to do research on hexagonal architecture and its application as it will be used in allprojects. Furthermore, I did an ERD for a new web application, converted this ERD to anactual database using postgresql on pgadmin and worked on its API. For the API, I wasassigned to use node.js, javascript language on webstorm and sequelize to link the applicationto the database. Illustrating, my task was to create a code by javascript that does the featuresstated in the use case, in which each feature includes mapping the http request to the logicand handling it then the response is shown in the database and the http response.Afterwards, Iwas assigned to do research on normalization and denormalization  as well as a presentationon that topic. In addition, I had a task to add a specific feature in one of the company’salready existing APIs using javascript.After this, my next task was to replace part of anexisting API from go language to typescript with the same logic, architecture andresponses.For this task I used dbeaver to monitor the effect on database , node on webstorm,typeORM to link application to database  and postman to compare responses. Lastly, Iresearched and presented the topic of serverless computing.This internship had a great impact on my skills as it improved my problem solving,presentation, technical, teamwork, flexibility and searching skills by the given tasks. This isas interacting with others, working with a language, library, architecture or an IDE that I havenever used before, trying to reach a specific goal were all mandatory in each task. I was verysatisfied with the internship experience. As for influencing my future career plans, I think thatI got a greater view and wider understanding of the IoT technology as well as the differentroles and types of developers which is helping me on setting my mind upon the jobs andfields of work that best suits me and the courses I can take in the future.Being very related tomy studies,this experience gave me the chance to have a real life application to my studies.For example, using postgresql that we studied in databases 2 course, javascript, node and httpfrom the networks course, the architectures from the software course, ERD from database 1course and coding and OOP from CSEN 1, 2, 3 and 4 courses.Finally, I would highlyrecommend this company to other GUC students.To sum up, through the different tasks and the company environment in this internshipexperience I have enjoyed practising my skills as well as acquiring new ones. In addition tohaving a real life application on what I have been learning at university and having a widerunderstanding of how work life is. Furthermore, I got to know about IoT technology which isthe main specialisation of the company and how it is related to our surroundings. IoT can beshown as a network of physical objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and othertechnologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices andsystems over the internet which  can be used in a wide range of functionalities.
