Tasks:  (Not less than 100 words)  
I helped with two different projects. The first project is a meeting room digital signage app. This app was 
linked to a database, which was used to display data from the database on the web app, such as the 
employees a ttending the meeting and other information about the meeting that will be held in the meeting 
room. The app also included several functionalities, such as providing employees with a form to sign up for the 
meeting they are attending. The second project I w orked on was a queuing system to assist organisations in 
queuing clients who were waiting. Bank Misr and Town Hospital are two organisations that have used our 
queuing system. I used the tools I learned in the ACL, such as the MERN Stack. For the queuing s ystem, I have 
made research on queuing systems available, which includes the elements of a queuing system. I usually arrive 
at work between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and begin the day with a brief meeting with my team and supervisor to 
discuss the tasks for the da y, then work on these tasks with my team throughout the day.
