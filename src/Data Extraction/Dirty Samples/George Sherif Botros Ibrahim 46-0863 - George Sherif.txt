Tasks:  (Not less than 100 words)  
 
During the project, I was working on figuring out guidelines for stationary and moving vibrations on the palm, 
which helps in better perception of the vibrations applied from the 15 motors attached to the p alm. The project 
was divided into 2 necessary modules and 1 additional part, which I proposed to apply along with my 
supervisor. The first module dealt with stationary vibrations on the palm, where I carried out a user study with 
16 participants, who were mainly students from the university. I investigated moving vibrations on the palm and 
how people perceived them during the second module. This was achieved  by carrying out another user study 
with 20 participants. These 2 modules resulted in the design guid elines for the vibrotactile display on the palm. 
The additional part was concerned with machine learning, where I implemented models to improve the 
localization equation used in parts 1 and 2. This resulted in a 30% improvement to the original equation.
