The title of my topic is Iterative Single Image Depth Prediction and Semantic Segmentation. In this intern, different techniques have been tested to merge the semantic segmentation model and depth model iteratively as the features of each model will be merged with RGB image to enhance the other model. PSPNet, which is a semantic segmentation model, has been used as a base model for semantic segmentation in addition to depth, in order to obtain the depth model,the output layers have been modified and the loss function has been adapted. Finally,the proposed model has been trained and validated on the SUN-RGBD dataset against the state-of the-art. And the experiments found that, training the models starting with a helper pretrained model acts better than training the two models together from scratch.
