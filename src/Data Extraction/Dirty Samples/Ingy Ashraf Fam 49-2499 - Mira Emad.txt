Activities When the company first contacted me to fill me in on the details of my internship period the plan was that Iâ€™ll be training for 2 weeks and watching online courses to learn the language they were working with, which was angular JS, and get trained to use their own builder to do my tasks. They said that training would take 2 weeks and maybe more depending on how fast I learn, but I took 3 days and on the fourth day I started working on a project they were working on (creating the atm interface of an Egyptian bank) and joined the team immediately. I got my own tasks which were mostly front-end related (designing pages and creating Physical Components to be used in the ncr builder). I had a couple of backend tasks related to parsing and decoding bank messages received from the bank and customizing the functions available on the software according to the capabilities of the atm machine. As I have never learned Angular JS in any of my courses at the university till now, most of my work was self learning and research.
