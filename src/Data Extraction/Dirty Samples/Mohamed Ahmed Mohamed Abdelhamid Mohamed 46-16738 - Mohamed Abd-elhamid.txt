 The internship was 1.5 months long and it started by meeting my supervisor Randa Ayman who then guided me throughout this period of time. The working location was at the organization in Smart Village for 5 days a week and a period of 8 hours per day. It started by reading/watching material related to continuous integration (Cl) to be able to work with a software called Jenkins to build a pipeline for the company. But the main focus for me was to build a dashboard for the department based on the requirements of the managers who wanted to answer a lot of the questions related to the department through graphs. For this task we used data provided by the company through their database (BigQuery). After retrieving the data needed through SQL queries, | started building the dashboard using Google Data Studio.
