activitiesIn the internship, we were trying to enhance the user experience for the users who attempt totransfer their data from the Facebook application to other platforms such as Google Photos,Dropbox, and Google drive. The main goals of the internship were to record some data aboutthe usage of the “transfer your data” feature, analyze and visualize this data, and simplify thedata transfer flow for the users. My internship project was to be finalized in 10 weeks and hadstretch goals to be worked on in the last two weeks.At the beginning of the internship, I met with my intern manager. He discussed with me myinternship project plan and showed me the timeline for the tasks of the project. He alsogathered some information about my usual role in a work team and my preferred workinghours. After that, I was directly working with my intern manager and three team memberswho were my peers. The progress of the project was discussed each week in a meeting withmy intern manager, another one with my peers, and a third meeting with the entire team. Bythe end of each week, I used to write posts for the team to show them the results achieved sofar. Sometimes we had team gatherings after working hours to do some funny activity.The internship onboarding happened in the first week of the internship. During this week, Ireceived my tech equipment, finished their set-up, and started to learn about the company'sinternal tools. I also completed some of the starter tasks to get used to the codebase and thetools used there. In the second and third weeks of the internship, I was working on recordingthe sources from which the users came to transfer their data. This recording was done for theFacebook web, Facebook mobile, and Facebook lite. I learned new programming languagesand frameworks such as Hack and Ent framework. I also performed some tasks using Reactjs. In the fourth week, I continued to record the same data in more parts of the codebase usingHack and React js as well. In the fifth week, I worked on visualizing the recorded data usingone of the company’s internal tools and wrote the queries for data retrieving using SQL. Inthe sixth week, I started to enhance the flow of the user's steps to transfer the data from theFacebook website when he/she comes from external platforms. In the seventh week, Ienhanced the flow for transferring albums from the Facebook website to other platforms. Inthe eighth week, I did the same for the Facebook videos. During these three weeks, I wasworking with React js. In the ninth and tenth weeks, I enhanced the user flow for theFacebook mobile using the “Hack” programming language. I also created tests for theseflows to ensure everything is working fine. In the last two weeks, I started to work on one ofthe stretch goals of the internship. The goal was to add some connections to the tool bychanging some code written in Java related to the internship project. Unfortunately, I didn’tfinish it before leaving. All the code changes made to finish the tasks were submitted forreview first. The managers and peers had to review my code first and either leave commentson the submitted work or accept it. After their acceptance, I had the chance to deliver it to thecodebase.Internship
