Tasks: I was tasked to the Teminos T24 system which is the core banking system of the AAIB. I was given a cubicle to work in and was provided with presentations and notes to help me learn the T24 system. Typically, my day starts at 8 in the morning at the digital factory on the south 90 road, then I meet with my team members where we have small chats until we start working. Everyday, the team member teach me new things about the T24 system and then test me with it by giving tasks to complete by the end of the day. I worked on the T24 test website and used my preferred text editor to code on it. I conducted research on the concepts of database and I found it helpful to get used to the idea of core banking systems in general.
