 In this internship, I have worked mainly on one project. The project was performed using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). We first started by collecting the requirements for the web application by looking at other similar web applications and writing the most important features that should be included as user stories, then I started designing the web application using layout using Figma for the frontend, and lucid chart for the backend. Finally, I started coding, which took most of the internship's time, I had to learn and use UI/UX best practices for the frontend, for the backend I implemented many security features such as CSRF(Cross Site Request Forgery) protection, XSS(Cross Site Scripting) protection, etc. I used a tool called Snyk that scans all your code for vulnerabilities, then I fixed all these issues. I also had to deal with external  APIs (such as Google sign in)
