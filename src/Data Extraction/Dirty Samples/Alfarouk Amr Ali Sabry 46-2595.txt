Tasks:In this internship, I have worked mainly on one project. The project was performed using MERN stack(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). We first started by collecting the requirements for the webapplication by looking at other similar web applications and writing the most important features that should beincluded as user stories, then I started designing the web application using layout using Figma for the frontend,and lucid chart for the backend. Finally, I started coding, which took most of the internship's time, I had to learnand use UI/UX best practices for the frontend, for the backend I implemented many security features such asCSRF(Cross Site Request Forgery) protection, XSS(Cross Site Scripting) protection, etc. I used a tool calledSnyk that scans all your code for vulnerabilities, then I fixed all these issues. I also had to deal with externalAPIs (such as Google sign in)Internship
