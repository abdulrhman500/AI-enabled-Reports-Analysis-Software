Tasks:
In this internship, I was working on a project called “The Pivot Project” which was intended to
come up with an automation solution to control the pivot in the smart farm, in order to be fullyautomated remotely . I was in char ge of developing a prototype for an automation website for the
smart farm. I was working solo on this project, reporting directly to the technical director of the
company , which gave me a sense of responsibility and really made me experience the working
environment dif ferently . As a result, I had conducted lots of research in-order to achieve my
weekly tasks. I was working with visual studio code in order to build the mock up of the website
and used APIs to integrate the backend with the frontend. Moreover , I was discovering how to
send data via cell phone sim cards.
