I have been hired as a full stack developer intern, working on components for both websites . The usual working
day was working from home, starting 9AM till 5PM. First, we would have a quick 10-minute meeting in which
tasks are given out to each intern. Later during the day , a final meeting would take place to update my
supervisor on my tasks.
I have had several tasks throughout this internship, such as:
●
Defining the database schema for a new entity using PostgreSQL, this new entity was called Meetings
(which keeps track or logs information, such time, class name, and link to meeting, about classes
explained through online meetings)
●
Programming the backend logic, using Node.JS, for several functions when dealing with Meetings. Such
as creating, updating, deleting a meeting.
●
Designing the frontend style for the entity Meetings. Through Angular .JS/HTML/CSS, an intuitive
design (color , components, feedback, styling) for the tutor to log and create Meetings logs was
programmed. After a lot of testing with the tutors of the website, we have reached an acceptable design.
