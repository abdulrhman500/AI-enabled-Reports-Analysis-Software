Tasks:  As a research intern, I had completed a wide variety of assignments. First of all, I had a considerable measure of papers to read more deeply, a large number of federated learning algorithms to thoroughly comprehend, and I needed to figure out some back draws about them and attempt to fill in the blanks. In addition to this, the task required that I investigate a wide range of distinct datasets and image classification models and select the ones that were the best fit for the task that was to be done. In order to accomplish that goal, I carried out a lot of different experiments. Moreover, since the research involved Human Computer Interaction (HCI), I was required to conduct a survey in order to collect some responses concerning that topic.   Internship
