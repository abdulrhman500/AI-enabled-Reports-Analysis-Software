Activities:   This internship combines technical and soft skills during the internship period. The available tracks in the Eva hackathon are frontend, backend, oracle, IOS and android. I was assigned and chosen in frontend track with other 15 trainee. The first half of internship focused more on boosting our knowledge about frontend web development with remotely online live sessions that last for 4 hours daily to engage more in frontend development (2 days off). After each session a mini project based on the giving session content is to be solved and submitted. The technical sessions starts with basic web development tools including HTML, CSS and Javascript and finally ended with more advanced tools including typescript and frontend development framework called Angular. The soft skills are scheduled once per week on Thursday. Soft skills sessions include Presentation Skills, Business Writing, Emotional Intelligence, Decision Making, Agile methodology and Data Science. After learning and engaging with frontend development fundamentals it was time to develop a real integrated project that combines more than one track together in one big project. The available offered projects were Limitless E-commerce Mobile, Limitless Care Website, Limitless web e-commerce, Reserve Dr. Appointments, Animal Health, SPOC Orders, EVA filters & Cafeteria App, Car Reservation, Meals system (coupons). I was honored to be assigned to Reserve Dr. Appointment project that consists of 2 backend and 2 frontend members. Each project is monitored by related mentors and a project manager. The goal of Reserve Dr. Appointment product is to give our doctors an easy way to manage appointments within their clinics and maintain their patients’ histories. The portal should have 2 different user privileges, one for the doctor and another for his assistant. A set of meetings are to be set weekly with our mentors and project manager to discuss and track the last updates reached in the project. The project consists of exactly 10 user stories that were divided on the frontend members thus; I was taking 5 user stories. The user stories I was assigned to: login form, home page, reserve appointment, edit appointment and add new patient. After 3 weeks of dedication and hard work on Reserve Dr. Appointment project we managed to finish it successfully. At the end we were asked to present our project in front of Eva pharma project managers in order to, evaluate and discuss the final output project.
