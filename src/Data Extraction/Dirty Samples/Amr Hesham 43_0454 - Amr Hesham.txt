Tasks:   
In this internship, not only was I given the opportunity to train as an associate product 
owner, but I also spent some time with project managers and business analysts. This has helped 
me broaden m y mind to different aspects of how the company functions. I have attended a lot of 
meetings, starting with the requirements gathering meetings and onto the analysis and scrum 
meetings. I have witnessed and been part of how the agile system for software dev elopment 
works as I have been taught in my SE course at the university. I have also written a product 
backlog for a loyalty program that is yet going to be announced by the company. I was 
introduced to some of the CBE’s (Central Bank of Egypt) regulations that concern running the 
Fintech business. I’ve been taught how to hunt for suitable clients and practiced sales pitches to 
get clients on board.
