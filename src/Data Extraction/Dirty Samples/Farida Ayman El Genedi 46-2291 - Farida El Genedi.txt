 My main role was as a Java developer. 1 would have mentorship sessions three times per week where each session was approximately 2 hours with my supervisor Eng. Bassem. These sessions were focused on using Java to create applications for android development where we looked at codes they used in previous projects and other popular applications like Google Earth and discussed its functionality and how it translates to the application, After these sessions, I was assigned tasks in the project they are currently working on for a telecom company and used Jenkins along with tortoise SVN for version control and maintenance. After each task I submit, I go over my work with my supervisor and discuss any errors or possible optimization. That way, I learned a lot due to the prompt feedback, and my work was also monitored to not affect the final project if my code had structural issues. I also participated in daily SCRUM meetings and learned how to keep up with my colleagues and how to give/receive feedback.
