The first task required of us was to provide an automated voting system to choose the final label of the audio from 4 labels. This task was written in code in python and then I provided a brief statistical analysis of the csv file we were working on, summarizing the number of audios in each emotion also using the same code in python. The second task asked of us was to create a code to minimize  the background noise in the audio files, this task was also done using python.
