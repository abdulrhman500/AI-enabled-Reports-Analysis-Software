activities and performed tasked  
At the start  of the internship, I have been assigned to some tasks in the project 
Offersandonly(Online Store) where I have understood the scenarios for Online store creation and 
design where we use various front -end and back -end tools and technologies like (HTML, CSS,  
JAVASCRIPT) to do the implementation, handling all the scenarios in the application is mainly 
what I learned from my work in that part of the internship.  
And after that I was assigned an Online Exam application task which was really interesting as 
there w ere supposed to be an application that had different rules like (student, teacher, admin, 
etc.) with different permissions and access.  
In that project I had a couple of tasks, the first one was adding more features to the application in 
the analysis phase,  and the second one which was completing the ERD (Entity Relationship 
Diagram) diagram for the Data Base relations.
