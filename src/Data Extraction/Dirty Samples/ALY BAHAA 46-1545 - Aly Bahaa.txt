Tasks: The internship was split into 4 weeks were each week we explore a different field of software engineering. During the first week I learnt about RPA and automation engineering using automation anywhere software. Using this software we can easily automate a lot of the daily routine processes done by engineers and actually by the end of the first week we implemented a bot that sends confirmation mails to the company's clients. For the second and third week we started front-end development where we used Angular as the framework. We started by building small projects as some of us were not familiar with angular then we had access to their actual code where we fixed some bugs and this was our first push to github and our first actual contribution. For the final week I switched to mobile development as I always thought of it as an interesting field, I learnt one of the most in-demand technologies which is flutter and by the end of the internship I built a simple e-commerce app using flutter.
