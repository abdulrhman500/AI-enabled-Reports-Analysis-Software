TasksThe internship started on 24 July 2022 and ended on 15 September 2022. The work was shared among threeteam members. We worked together remotely for a duration of 8 weeks - 30 hours per week - under thesupervision of Dr. Mervat Abu-Elkheir at the GUC (German University in Cairo).  The first 1-2 weeksmainly involved studying the most recent literature on the subject, and how could the different languagemodels be utilized to generate poetry. In parallel to that, we started with collecting the needed data for ourintended task from different online resources and cleaned the data by removing noise and redundantinformation. Additional scraping was done to fill in missing values and to add a new needed column to thedataset. The data engineering was conducted multiple times over the internship duration; whenever the needfor more pre-processing is realised. Next, we experimented with training two different transformer-basedlanguage model architectures: an encoder-decoder model and a decoder-only model to generate poetry basedon a prompted meter, and on a prompted topic.1 On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation ModelsBesides the primary tasks, I was mainly responsible for training the encoder-decoder model and furthertransforming the data to be passed to the models. While my teammate took on the responsibility of thedecoder-only model. All the work was implemented in Python, employing mainly the Transformers library2.After training the models and collecting the generated poems, we contacted experts in the classicalArabic poetry to evaluate and judge the quality of the generated poems against Manurungâ€™s threepreconditions for successful AI-generated poems: (i) grammaticality, (ii) meaningfulness and (iii)poeticness.3Two surveys were sent out: one including poems generated by the two models based on a prompted topic,and another including poems generated based on meters. Additionally, we employed existing automatic toolsto test how much our model adheres to meters and measure their accuracy.Finally, during the last week of the internship, we collected the results of the evaluations and compared them.We compiled the findings and shared them in a paper we submitted  - and was later accepted - to theWANLP20224 workshop in EMNLP2022. Examples of the generated poetry are shown in the Appendix.
