Tasks:   
I had my summer inter nship the re before so I helped with finalizing the system change from oracle 10g desktop 
application to oracle 10g web application which included re design ing the forms to fit the new medi um, and 
tweak and rewrite the SQL  queries that are used in the reports to retrieve the needed records from the database.  
I made new  reports and forms  using SQL  and oracle 10g  from scratch  on my own  that were  asked for by other 
employees and I fixed any bugs  that were reported  in any existing repo rts. I also worked with other team 
members on writing the SQL  queries for the really important comprehensive repor ts that the high management 
needed .
