Activities: In this internship I have learned the Microsoft power platform, which combines low-code application development, workflow automation, AI bot development, and data analytics with broad connectivity through Microsoft Dataverseâ€”all designed to work with the secure, trusted, Microsoft cloud services of Azure, Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365. I learned about the power apps, power BI, and power automate. I was given 3 main tasks in this internship which were 1- Implement a full inventory management system using power apps with an admin and a user interfaces, 2- Integrate this app with power BI for inventory data analysis and statistics and draw flow charts, bar charts and all the data visuals needed for inventory stock/purchase data statistics, 3- Integrate the app with power automate to create work flows for announcements, purchase approvals and sending emails when needed.
