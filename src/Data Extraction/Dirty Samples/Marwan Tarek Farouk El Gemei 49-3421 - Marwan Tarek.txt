Tasks:  I was asked to build an E -commerce Educational Online store  website which 
is a part of the company's plan  in the future. I was asked to build the website using ASP.NET core(  using C# 
and building REST API 's) for the backend, Microsoft Server SQL( database built through migrations) and 
Angular framework(using HTML,SCSS and TypeScript) for the frontend. The journey  that I performed was 
first building the database,  then building  controllers and API's to send the data for the front end, then receiving 
the data at the frontend from the API's using typescript and including any logic needed, then building and 
styling the UI using html and scss, then finally building the UX and displa ying the data using html and 
typescript. I was asked to cover both the user and the admin parts. The tasks that I performed  for the user are 
Sign Up, Logi n, creating a shop for products and creating these functionalities for the shop: paging, filtering, 
sorting and searching then letting users view the products, c reating a cart and letting users add products to it and 
editing it, creating a checkout module for the orders, viewing, editing and submitting orders, viewing and 
editing their profile, viewing ord er tracking, viewing order history. The tasks that I performed for the admin 
were Login, viewing, adding and editing products, viewing orders submitted by the user and either accepting or 
rejecting them. All of these were built using Microsoft Visual Studi o, Visual Studio Code, Postman and docker.
