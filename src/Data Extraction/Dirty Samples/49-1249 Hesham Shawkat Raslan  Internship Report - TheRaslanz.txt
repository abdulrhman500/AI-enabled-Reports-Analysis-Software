Tasks: At the start of the internship, we all met (the interns) and our mentors gave us some time to get to know each other and feel more comfortable because they said it will lead to a better and more productive workspace and we were then assigned into teams of 3 and given to us was our first task which was to view and understand the database schema (using MS SQL) of the company then we were gathered to make sure we all the same view for the schema and discuss further improvement. We then had the big task that was going to take up most of our time, Our mentor told us to imagine we have a client (in this case it is the company) and they need a designed interface therefore our goal was to plan and implement dashboard for admins in order to manipulate the company database. To start we used AST.Net Framework to create the backend API’s that we saw that they may be needed , for example we implemented the get , post, delete , patch API’s. We then started working on Angular HTML and CSS to start implementing our front end for the dashboard, which made things on the easier side to connect our front end to backend by proxying/sending requests from front to back end. Every couple of days we were asked as a task, to code review our teammates which had the purpose of making us all see different perspectives and thinking processes as well as getting a sense of organizing our code. We were also asked to research more about the applications/software we were using so we can widen our knowledge about what we have in hand.  Internship
