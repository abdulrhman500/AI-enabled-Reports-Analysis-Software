Tasks:
In this internship the first task was to study an online course to make sure that everyone has the same basic
knowledge. The course was of fered by Andrew Ng on Youtube. The course is mainly covering machine
learning with all its aspects and details. After finishing the course a task was assigned to each team. We were
asked to compare between dif ferent types of clustering algorithms. We chose Density-based clustering,
Distribution-based clustering, Hierarchical clustering, and Centroid-based clustering to perform our task on. We
got a data set to apply the algorithms on and performed data preprocessing on it to remove anything that we did
not want or unnecessary . After applying each clustering algorithm using python in jupyter notebook, a
comparison between them was made. Another task was to locate each atm of Banque Misr and National Bank
of Egypt and present them on a map. The first thing that was done was data scraping using an online api for
each atm of the banks to get its address and another online api to get each addressâ€™ s longitude and latitude to be
able to locate it on the map. Some data preprocessing was made on the data to ensure that these are the atms we
want. Then we presented the atms on the map using power pi. The visualization included all the atms of the two
banks and you can choose a certain governorate to view its atms or even view one atm on the map. The last task
was to estimate the population using satellite images. We achieved the data using an online source code in
python and got these photos as our data and applied some data preprocessing on it and then applied a neural
network algorithm to it to predict using python on jupyter notebook.
