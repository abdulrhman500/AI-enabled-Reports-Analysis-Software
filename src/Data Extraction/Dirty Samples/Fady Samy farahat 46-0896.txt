I was assigned to 3 main tasks during my internship at  Farahat Co. For Cooling & Air 
conditioners . Firstly, to attend live discussions with the instructor (Eng.Mostafa Mohamed). 
During the live discussions each day the instructor starts to explain the tasks will be implemented during the day. Secondly, I start  to integrate the material we took by code using (HTML,  CSS,  
javascript,  Bootstrap,Vue js) .Thirdly , Eng.  Mostafa Mohamed starts  to evaluate the code made 
by me .The working conditions were as follows; 5 days per week completing 6 hours per day for 
a whole month.  
The main target of this internship was to create a website that  allows potential customers to 
easily select the refrigeration  equipment they are interested in and within the chosen product 
category  customer can sort and filter on brand, refrig erant, capacity , etc. 
 
We used HTML,  CSS,   javascript,  Bootstrap,  Vue js via  Visual Studio Code and Atom in the 
whole internship.  
I was assigned to make a project which is to make an online shopping website  using  Vue js  that 
can be used by the company by just importing the productâ€™s  images,  descriptions  and prices . Also, 
the big project included a shopping cart that adds up all the selected products and gives  the user 
the total price and if the user wants  to edit anything in the shopping cart t hey can.
