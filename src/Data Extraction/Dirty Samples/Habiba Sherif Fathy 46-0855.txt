Tasks:  
My task s included sitting with the consultant s to gather their requirements and determine if it 's feasible  or not . I 
used ABAP code , which  is a high -level programming language create d by the German software company SAP 
SE, to make some en hancements to the UI. The enhancements which  can be made to the sof tware using ABAP 
are RICEF : Reports, Interface, Conver sions, Enhancements and Forms . The reports  and forms are creat ed by  
first w riting my code fi le and then creati ng the in terface . The code file uses the ABAP s yntax which is similar 
to SQL . I would start by defin ing my datatypes, variable s and parameters . The n I would select the fi elds I want 
to acces s from my database table into an Internal Table that is local to m y file. This internal table would be like 
a smaller version of the main database table with only the fields that I need in my report/form. At last, I would 
perform any nee ded actions on the fields and show them in my report/form. Most of the reports  and forms that 
need to be created would need to access field s from across multiple database tables and so the querying process 
would get more complex depending on the requirements of the consul tant. After my code is done, I w ould 
create the UI of the report /form. The reports and forms need to be customized for each company  by adding the 
company logo and foll owing their requi red layouts.  
My tasks sometimes included debuggi ng my colleagues ' work t o try and figure out where the error is  and to 
solve it.
