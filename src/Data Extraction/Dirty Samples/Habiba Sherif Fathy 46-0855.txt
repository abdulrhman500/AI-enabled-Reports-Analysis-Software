Tasks: My tasks included sitting with the consultants to gather their requirements and determine if it's feasible or not. I used ABAP code, which is a high-level programming language created by the German software company SAP SE, to make some enhancements to the UI. The enhancements which can be made to the software using ABAP are RICEF: Reports, Interface, Conversions, Enhancements and Forms. The reports and forms are created by first writing my code file and then creating the interface. The code file uses the ABAP syntax which is similar to SQL. I would start by defining my datatypes, variables and parameters. Then I would select the fields I want to access from my database table into an Internal Table that is local to my file. This internal table would be like a smaller version of the main database table with only the fields that I need in my report/form. At last, I would perform any needed actions on the fields and show them in my report/form. Most of the reports and forms that need to be created would need to access fields from across multiple database tables and so the querying process would get more complex depending on the requirements of the consultant. After my code is done, I would create the UI of the report/form. The reports and forms need to be customized for each company by adding the company logo and following their required layouts.  My tasks sometimes included debugging my colleagues' work to try and figure out where the error is and to solve it.  Internship
