 First of all I was assigned to take some tutorials about ASP.Net, SQL, JavaScript, and AngularJS. In this internship, I was given many tasks which helped me gain many skills. I've learnt a lot about software development and database administration. Their database was used to hold all the data about the shipments and their departure arrival timings. I was also given tasks about assisting employees in the company with computer problems that they encounter. I've installed several software that they needed. Also, I had to comprehend how their database was designed and do some tasks concerning it. I worked also on their system to solve issues in it. Also, I've worked on improving their website and solving bugs provided by the quality control team.
