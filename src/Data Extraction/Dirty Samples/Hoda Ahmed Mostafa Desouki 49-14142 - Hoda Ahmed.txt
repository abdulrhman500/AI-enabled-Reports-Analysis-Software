 I had two tasks to perform, the first one was a collaborative work on  enhancing the E/E Architecture of the smart E-Bike and the second one is to provide a solution  to the path planning problem which is basically planning how the bike will maneuver from point  A to point B without hitting obstacles  E/E Architecture: I worked along with my colleagues to provide an enhancement to the  already implemented system. The old Architecture had many drawbacks such as  1.  2 3. 4  The wires can get tangled and interchanged  The wires can be abruptly disconnected which can lead to accidents  It's very hard to trace back the wires for debugging  Using long wires adds extra clutter to the system. In addition, long signal wires results in high resistance compared to shorter ones.  It is hard for the user to ride the bike with all the mounted parts exposed  All of the above-mentioned drawbacks were solved by the following modification steps  (kindly check appendix at the end of this report for pictures comparing the E-Bike status  before and after the modifications):  1. Shortening the long wires by cutting them and welding  2. Replacing the throttle signal wire with a shorter one  3. Mounting the components on the triangular wood piece  4. Covering up the components using a similar triangular wood piece 5  Covering up the external wires with a coiled cable management sleeve  Furthermore, we designed some explanatory diagrams for the new Architecture: An E/E Architecture schematic, an E/E Architecture module and a fritzing simulation of the hardware  components (kindly check the appendix)  e My second task was to provide a path-planning algorithm that is not computationally heavy in order to have a real-time response. I have introduced the RRT Algorithm as a candidate to implement on the bike and simulated its performance using Pygame (a  python library)
