Tasks:  (Not less than 100 words)  
 
Throughout  my first month,  I was given  sessions  about  JavaScript  basics  to develop  our skills,  and then we 
were  given  online  sessions  about  .NET  FRAMEWORK  that were  very beneficial  as our instructors  were  very 
helpful,  they went  through  .NET  FRAMEWORK  architecture  and history,  we were  also shown  the professional  
working  life and how they handle  all the team  work  and their tasks.  During  the other  month  we were  introduced  
to real projects  and developing  real tools  to providers,  as a team  we were  given  Vodafone  Cash  to learn  more  
about  problem  solving  throughout  the system  and arranging  our work  in team  work.
