activities  I have been assigned several tasks to do at Perfect Tech, at first my supervisor asked me to watch a youtube playlist “odoo mates” to learn how to install odoo on my computer and how to make it function properly, then I learned to link odoo and python”pycharm” locally on my computer,after linking them together I was asked to add custom Modules and custom addons in odoo,create new models to use in the database which was “postgres”, I also learned to create menues and action buttons in odoo,and also changing the access rights and the views from tree view to form view or vice versa. I was asked to override methods in odoo as the clients would like there ERP system to function that way. I was asked to add a feature to archive or unarchive, I also implemented a search feature to find wanted products or models,after I was experienced a bit my supervisor asked me to implement a small but a complete part of an ERP system for a company.  I used to work 5 days a week starting at 9 am,the company was generous enough to give me my own desk, the team was really helpful and they all kept trying to help me with the code whenever I faced any struggle, also MR Mahmoud, my supervisor, kept briefing me about what an ERP means and how I could benefit from it if I choose this career. I also talked a lot with their sales team to gain knowledge on how to reach more customers and how to make a company more well known.  I worked with odoo ERP v.14 , Postgres , Pycharm
