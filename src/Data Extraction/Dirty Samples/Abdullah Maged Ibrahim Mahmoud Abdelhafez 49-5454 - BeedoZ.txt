My main task in the internship was developing the backend of a fully-fledged, customer -facing, web-based
airplane-ticket-booking system. The booking system allows travelers to easily:
➔
search flights
◆
for one-way or round trips
➔
book tickets, by
◆
providing personal information (e.g. full name, passport number , nationality)
◆
choosing a certain available seat in the aircraft
◆
providing payment details
This was done using
Javascript
programming language,
NodeJS
,
Fastify
web framework,
NeDB
database,
git
for version control,
VS Code
for code editing,
Jest
for code testing and
Github Actions workflow
for
automatic
code testing. I had to install Linux Zorin OS instead of Windows on my laptop in order to have a smoother
programming experience as recommended by my direct supervisor . I worked 8 hours a day , typically in the
morning but sometimes the 8  hours were split into 4 hours in the morning and 4 in the evening. We held a
mandatory 10 minutes meeting every morning as well as a long 2 hours meeting at the end of each week to
follow up on progress.
