TasksMonth 1:The internship started with a meeting with the stakeholders to lay the grounds of theautomatic defense scheduling system. Constraints were discussed and the basic skeleton ofthe system was agreed upon. We started researching different algorithms to use to solve theproblem and after many meetings with my teammates we decided to use The GeneticAlgorithm with Shotgun-Hill Climbing.Month 2:The implementation of the algorithm started in month 2. The Algorithm contains somecomponents like solution representation, cost function and neighboring algorithm. So Istarted to represent the solution using python. The solution was represented as an array ofsize of the amount of slots. Each cell contained information about the assignment (Examiner,Supervisor and Student). Then I started to implement the cost function. The cost functioncalculates how much this solution costs. The lower the cost the better the solution is. Inmonth 2 the cost function  only calculates if the same examiner/supervisor is present in thesame slot more than two times.Month 3 and the remaining two weeks:Further advancements on the algorithm took place in month 3. Some Greedy Algorithmaspects were added into the algorithm. The cost function was also modified to account forcontinuity of slots and the number of working days an examiner has per schedule. As theconstraints given by the coordinators was that The Examiner should have continuous slotsand he should have no more than two working days per schedule.2Internship
