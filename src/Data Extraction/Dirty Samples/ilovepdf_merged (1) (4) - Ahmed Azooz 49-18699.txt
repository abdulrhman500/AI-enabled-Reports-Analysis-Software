Tasks
Month 1:
The internship started with a meeting with the stakeholders to lay the grounds of the
automatic defense scheduling system. Constraints were discussed and the basic skeleton of
the system was agreed upon. We started researching different algorithms to use to solve the
problem and after many meetings with my teammates we decided to use The Genetic
Algorithm with Shotgun-Hill Climbing.
Month 2:
The implementation of the algorithm started in month 2. The Algorithm contains some
components like solution representation, cost function and neighboring algorithm.
So
I
started to represent the solution using python. The solution was represented as an array of
size of the amount of slots. Each cell contained information about the assignment (Examiner,
Supervisor and Student). Then I started to implement the cost function. The cost function
calculates how much this solution costs. The lower the cost the better the solution is. In
month 2 the cost function  only calculates if the same examiner/supervisor is present in the
same slot more than two times.
Month 3 and the remaining two weeks:
Further advancements on the algorithm took place in month 3. Some Greedy Algorithm
aspects were added into the algorithm. The cost function was also modified to account for
continuity of slots and the number of working days an examiner has per schedule. As the
constraints given by the coordinators was that The Examiner should have continuous slots
and he should have no more than two working days per schedule.
