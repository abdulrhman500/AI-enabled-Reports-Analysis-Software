activities is that I was using my learnings from python and other programming courses in order to write my code on google collab and also math courses in order to understand the clustering algorithms and the data. A few courses that I believe were related to the internship include: CSEN 102, CSEN 202, Math 401.  To conclude, the internship was all around a great experience it gave me a different look on corporate life. Furthermore, it helped me acquire new knowledge in data science and machine learning and opened my eyes to a possible career path that I might pursue in the future. The environment that Vodafone created for its interns allowed us to network with each other and expand our knowledge in different fields of work by the sessions given and the events they created. Working in the big data team made me realize how important it is for big companies and how it allows the company to understand their consumers and be able to target them with the products that would most likely be relevant to them.
