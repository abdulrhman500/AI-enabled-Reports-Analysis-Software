activities:  
We were divided into teams of 4 Students. An Egypt ian series was assigned to each team to 
extract audio files from it. First, the Egyptian series “welad nas” was assigned for us, each 
member has chosen 5 episodes. The supervisor provided a list of names for the actors that we 
need to extract their voices.  I started extracting audio files from the episodes from 6 to 10 using 
audacity software to record their emotions which varied between “happy – sad – neutral – angry 
– fearful – surprised “. Using Eclipse IDE and Java Programming language I was able to bui ld 
program that can provide me with statistics for my Dataset and decides for each record which 
emotion gets the highest voting as for each record, as each member listens to the records of other 
team members and writes the emotion he felt from the voice ba sed on his point of view, as a result we can reach to a more efficient result for each record  
 
The previous snap shows some statistics for the first series. A new series was then assigned to us 
– Al Zeybaq – and I kept extracting records until I reached the target set for me “ 500 records “ 
and Also I listened to total of 1500 records which were extracted by my friends and I added my 
suggestion for the emotion I heard from the actor voice. Then by applying the technique I 
developed with Java. The program made a voting based on our suggestions and added the final 
result with the most accurate emotion. We also attended a meeting with Prof. Mohamed Salem. 
At which we saw the result of our hard working as our team along with other teams were able to 
build a hu ge dataset for Egyptian speech (more than 15000 records ) from which 6000 records 
were examined with All needed tests and it was valid and showing really good results for the 
current machine learning project.
