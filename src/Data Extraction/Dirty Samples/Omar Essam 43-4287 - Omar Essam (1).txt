Tasks:  At the start I star ted learning about Kalman filter and Its 
applications and then I started applying  my knowledge by d oing some tasks on lab data using linear 
kalman filter and non -linear kalman filter after that, then I started working on the actual project which 
was es timating the p osition vector of a joint in the coordinate space of inertial measurement  unit in which 
I used python as my scripting language and I used some libraries lik e Autog rad, I also implemented my 
own library to calculate the Jacobean  matrix and compare it with the Autograd result , I also used the DFKI 
servers to run my code to get bett er tunning parameters  for my extended kalman filter algorithm , and I 
also tried to use reinforced  learning to get better parameters .
