Activities: Every day the working hours were from 9 AM to 5 PM and there was a daily meeting with my supervisor and team to check on the work that we have done so far and so that I would report back on my progress along with my team mates. I was part of a team that was assigned to improve, upgrade and add new features to a website that is created to be used by the company’s managers and employees in order to make communications between them easier and to make assigning tasks to employees much easier. I, along with other interns, had the task of implementing both the backend and frontend of the website following The Agile Methodology so I got to work as a full stack developer. When my team and I were provided with the business requirements of the website, we formulated the user stories that were later implemented and their corresponding user points to create the backlog that were also implemented, then I was assigned a number of the user stories/methods to implement both the frontend and backend of then our work was integrated together to form the website as a whole. After implementing the methods in the backend, I would come up with different test cases for the unit testing of the methods in order to make sure that they are doing the desired job with all possible cases and I had to create a mongoDB database for testing purposes and fill it with test data to be able to test my user stories. Furthermore, I took the task of assessing my teammates’ implemented methods and if they worked properly, I would merge our work on Git and I would deploy the website at the end of every significant milestone. Moreover, the softwares that I used to finish my tasks were MongoDB, Postman. Git and Visual Studio Code. Regarding the stack used, I also used Express for the backend and React JS, which uses Javascript as a programming language, for the frontend. Internship
