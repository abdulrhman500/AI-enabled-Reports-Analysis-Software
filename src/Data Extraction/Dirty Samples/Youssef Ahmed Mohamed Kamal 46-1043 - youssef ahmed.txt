Tasks: During this internship, I was given a full review about how telecome companies use cloud technology to assign resources which are represented in terms of huge servers to their virtual machines upon request. I had a hands on experience where I had a daily task to create virtual machines on the test net and assign resources to them as in real life exactly.This involved me using Vodafone's test application in which you have the full image of the total resource, amount of servers available, virtual machines created and utilization. I had to deal also with crashes and overloading so I had an idea about how to manage these problems in real life.  Internship
