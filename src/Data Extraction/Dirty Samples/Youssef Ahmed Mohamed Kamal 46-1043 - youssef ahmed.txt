Tasks:  During this i nternship, I was given a full review about  how telecome 
companies use cloud techn ology to assign resources  which are represented in terms of huge servers  to their 
virtual machines  upon request. I had a hands on experience where I had a daily task to create virtual machines 
on the test net and assign resources to them as in real life exactly.This involved m e using Vodafone's test 
application i n which you have the full image of the total resource, amount of servers available, virtual  machines 
create d and utili zation.  I had to deal also with crashes and overloading so I had an idea about how to manage 
these problems in real life.
