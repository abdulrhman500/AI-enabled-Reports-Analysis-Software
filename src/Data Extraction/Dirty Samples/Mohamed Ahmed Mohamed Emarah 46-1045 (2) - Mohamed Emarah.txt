Tasks: First we were given a seminar of how each team in the companies operate, starting with drilling , procurement, supply chain and finally the IT department. After the seminar I was taught how to use the software Service Now , which is a software that keeps track of every device in the company and is also a ticketing system that handles any technical issues the users might have. I was responsible for handling most requests after learning to use the software. Secondly I was introduced to the server room and the data center and was taught the requirements to build a data center from the cost of every item to the power supply and cooling solutions. Later I was taught the benefits of cloud storage and was given tasks of migrating a project to the cloud. Finally I was assigned the task of creating an IT proposal with specific requirements to choose the best option for the office space , the devices needed for the company and how to maintain them , whether to opt for a physical data center or cloud storage and the different costs between them . I was then asked to present my IT solution to the IT managers.  Internship
