 The main project task was to design, develop and build a Deep Convolutional Neural Network in order to recognize the presence of tumors in Computed Tomography (CT) scans of Lungs. However, to accomplish such task it needs to be divided into many small sub-  tasks to track progress and monitor how close are we to finishing the project. The working hours of the  Neural Networks lab were 5 days per week 8 hours per day from 9 AM to 5 PM and the university campus was the hub where all team members gathered and worked on our many tasks. I went through many stages to finalize my Deep Neural Network project, starting with practicing on small tasks to build our confidence and comfortableness with the tools used, then we decided on the project, its need and general factors. Afterwards we started developing the project itself. Finally we went through testing  and debugging before closing in on the project and naming it complete.
