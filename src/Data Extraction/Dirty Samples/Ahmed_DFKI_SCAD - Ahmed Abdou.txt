Tasks:
    The main task is to develop an end-to-end neural network model for 3D planar reconstruction from single 
RGB image in Pytorch. It was divided into three sub tasks / branches  (planar instance segmentation, Depth 
prediction, Plane parameters estimation (normal, offset)). We started with segmentation and appended to it 
depth and plane parameters. We conducted many difficult experiments for each task to get the highest accuracy 
with the help of  a very great powerful cluster with huge GPUs and CPUs. This clusters saved a lot of time in 
the experiments. For each sub task we had time to research to find the best approach and then followed by the 
implementation. At the end of the internship We took some time to achieve best fusion between the three 
branches.
