Tasks:  (Not less than 100 words)  
 
Firstly, the day started with a meeting with our supervisor to assign to us the tasks required for the week. He 
gave us the excel sheets and resources that we should work on them. Secondly, I installed Microsoft SQL 
Server, and then imported the data given to me by the supervisor. The data consisted of two large excel sheets 
providing statistics and observations from 2019 to 2021, regarding Golden Eagle products. I started by 
importing the data and created table for every product. And by using the SQL query language, I was able to 
manipulate and join these tables to get final table showing crucial observations about these products such as 
detailed sales level yearly, quarterly and monthly in all the years provided. It also contained the most selling 
products with precise revenue generated by these products. The tables were manipulated by reducing them to 
multiple smaller tables, these smaller tables showed the company's consumers and what products they specially 
used and the gain of the company from those consumers. All of this in an attempt to compare the products and 
their insights to the data and insights of the company's competitors.
