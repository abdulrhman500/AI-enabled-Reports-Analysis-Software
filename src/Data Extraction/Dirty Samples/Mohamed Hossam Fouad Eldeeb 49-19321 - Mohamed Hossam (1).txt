 In this internship we worked in teams of four, we were required to get 500 audio samples of Egyptian arabic dialect from various sources, by recording , cutting and extracting the audios from their source , we would then label each sample (cither happy ,sad ,surprised ,angry ,fearful or neutral ) based on our feeling then add them to the team spreadsheet were other team members would label them (each sample has to be labeled by the entire team),to reduce the region of error. Other tasks included using google to get statistics about the collected data such as the count of each emotion , the number of females and males and also we made a labeling system to choose the final label of audio, it would label each audio file based which emotion was the most chosen for it by the team members. we also used python to apply automated noise reduction and silence removal on the samples.
