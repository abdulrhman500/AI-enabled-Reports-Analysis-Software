Tasks: (Not less than 100 words)    Furthermore, during my time at Crystal Mind I worked with various technologies; my tasks were mainly on their Retail Pro software, a retail management solution. The first thing I did was work on the software's POS (Point Of Sale) system. As my first task, I had to design and create the frontend for the login interface of the user, in this case, an employee of the retail store. I first had to understand the code through the comments and asking my supervisor about how the code works. I created the UI using Angular and CSS in which the user will enter his/her details, the details were sent and authenticated to the server-side powered by Delphi. This was my �����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������Angular was easier because of the abundance of resources available online. Delphi, on the other hand, was very difficult to understand because it is an older technology that is not commonly used nowadays, so my supervisor had to teach me how to use Delphi and integrate it with Angular. 4 Student Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt           My second task was on the checkout page of the software. It was my job to create the frontend of the checkout page, but unlike the first task, this task was far more challenging because of the many components and complexity involved. I created the cart component that included the items checked in using the barcode scanner. The item was another component that included the name, price, and serial number. Additionally, I worked on developing the transaction and customer information components, including the total price of the items, the taxes, and customer information such as his/her name and phone number. All of these components were implemented using Angular and styled using CSS.   One of the things I was exposed to during my internship was how difficult it is to deal with clients. ��������������������������-to-date hardware that is fast and efficient. As a software developer, I had to compensate by making the software perform as fast and efficiently as possible using clean and efficient code that doesn't overload the hardware. Among the simple techniques that I learned and used was to avoid and eliminate any unnecessary operations and variables and to break loops when necessary. This helps decrease the load on the hardware and allows the software to perform better.    As to the working condition, the typical working day was 9-5. There was a product manager, a team lead, and multiple software developers on every project. The tasks I was assigned were all under the supervision of a software developer that taught me the different technologies and helped me understand and finish the tasks. In most cases, I communicated with my supervisors by phone or using Whatsapp.   Internship
