activities  
The internship was carried out fully online, as the company is based in Qatar while I was 
working on my bachelor’s that semester. Throughout the internship I joined a team of f ull stack 
developers working on web development for one of the company's clients. Meetings were carried 
out through zoom and announcements and tasks given out through e -mails. As full stack 
developers, most of the programs used were ones similar to the one s used in the university’s 
semester 7 Advanced Computer Lab course, of which are React, Mongo DB and Node JS. Excel 
sheets were shared around to keep track of what has been done and what the next steps were. I 
had to do some research with regards to the fr ont-end development part, as it was my weakest 
point, a lot of Java Script/Node JS research with regards to implementing certain functions.
