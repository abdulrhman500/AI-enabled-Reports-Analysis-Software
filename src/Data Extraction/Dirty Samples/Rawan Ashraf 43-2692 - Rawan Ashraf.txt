Tasks
: I interned in the IT  department
where I collaborated with other interns
in a team to work on the tasks that were required throughout the internship. One of my very first tasks
was getting familiarized with the company’ s hierarchy which really aided us later on while conducting
other tasks. The following few days we were taken on tours in each of the company’ s directories
starting from the administration department all the way to the main control unit of gas all around
Egypt. Following that, I was able to have one on ones with petroleum engineers that explained to me in
depth how petroleum is extracted all around egypt, that was really interesting as I was able to link
almost all the theorems they use to the ones I took back in my Physics courses all throughout 1st and
2nd year of university . Moreover , I was able to really use my skills when we as a team were asked to
design a prototype for an alternative GUI of the company’ s main website using Figma. While
designing this prototype, the fact that we were previously introduced to the hierarchy of directors and
got to see first hand how each department functions as well as the Software Engineering course I took
in my 3rd year , really helped. The last task was the closest to my passion, which is web development.
