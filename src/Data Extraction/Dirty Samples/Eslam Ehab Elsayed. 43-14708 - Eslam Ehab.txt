Tasks:  
             In this internship period, I was lucky to have been given the op portunity to train with an exceptional 
team of IT members and data analysts. This has helped me grasp how companies technically handle and analyze 
their data; which was tightly related to what I have learned in my Data Engineering course on campus.  
I often  used to train from the IT department's office in the company, or else meetings were held online.  
I was first introduced to how they collected data of previous, active, upcoming orders. This helps provide them 
insights into what products are selling most a nd in which part of the country, which other products/meals are 
barely selling relative to others, etc.  
The point of sale (POS) system which is a reliable system for restaurants used to help us during our data 
collecting phase.  
I was introduced to POS whic h was used to present to us metrices like how often an extra product was 
requested, most popular orders/dishes, and the average billing per customer.  
I used to carry out some of the data visualization techniques I have learned in the DE course for both the  
companys tier A customers(hotels) besides the most selling products using both line and pie charts.  
This had been carried out to help us with quality control and customer segmentation for the company.
