tasks were equally distributed between us. Last but not least, tasks were more than insightful,  
combining perfectly between self -learning, and not too challenging . The internship undertaken at 
EGID will definitel y open the door to attain another opportunity to join EGIDâ€™s family again, 
whether as an intern or a full -timer . Moving on, the tasks correlated moderately with my studies. 
It was an application of what I studied; however the ways of presentation a re poles  apart. 
Databases I, Software Engineering and Advanced Computer Lab  were the academic courses that 
I have studied at the GUC and most related to my internship.  EGID is an organization that I 
would strongly recommend to other GUC students. It is a very prof essional place, great for 
growth, strengthening existing skills and knowledge.  
Conclusion : 
In a nutshell, this internship has taught me a lot. My mentor, Mahmoud Gaden , the department 
head , Hatem Iskander and colleague Farah Ihab  made this experience way more insightful and 
fun. Last summer, not only did I gain technical skills, but also business skills that will heavily 
impact my future career path. AngularJS and ASP.NET Core  were  new framework s that I have 
never worked with and are considered as a great addi tion to my existing coding and web 
development  skills. Technical skills aside, I have enhanced my teamwork skills, soft skills such 
as building my resume and a qualified LinkedIn account and also working under strict time 
constraints. Personally, the biggest asset  was gaining the skill of self -learning , exploring new 
field, and dealing with new tools  other than those  I used to work with at the university. 
Moreover, coping with  the job requirements and atmosphere is one of the m ain aspects that will 
serve my upcoming career path . Finally, working in the web d evelopment  department was such a 
challenging, yet advantageous experience as it taught a lot by doing, not just observing.
