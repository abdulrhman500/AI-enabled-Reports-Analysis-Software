Tasks:  
I took the 3 weeks of the internship exploring ISA-18.2 alarm management system. To update some
functionality related to distrubuition-power system and water control system. And I read to the 
systems and read the manuals for alarm system and how it is scheduled with all other systems to one
Bay control units (BCU). The main task was to create log files for all the information and signals 
from distrubuition-power system and water control system. I was working in producing log files for
status of the current system on specific periods during the day. These log files will help them in 
tracking misbehaved systems in the whole BCUs.
