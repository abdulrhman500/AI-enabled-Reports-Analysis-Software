Tasks:   
 
I was an intern Back -End developer using Java's Spring  Boot. Initially, I delved deeper into Java's complex 
concepts like collection framework, memory management, serialization, and build tools (Maven and Gradle). 
Then I studied Spring Boot, a new framework for creating controller s with endpoints, services, and models. 
Following that, I began receiving tasks such as internal or customer bug fixes, and product enhancement 
through the implementation of a new feature. Developing a new feature entailed working with the Front -End 
team a nd the UI/UX team to find the best possible solution for this enhancement. In addition, I documented 
everything I worked on and pointed out some bugs to other teams.
