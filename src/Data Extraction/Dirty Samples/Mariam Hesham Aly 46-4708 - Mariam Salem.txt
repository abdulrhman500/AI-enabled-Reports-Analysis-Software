Activities: ISM (Information storage and management) version 4 was the programme I was learning for my internship. To start with, I was given a brief overview of the ISM modules and subjects. The subjects I studied included (Cloud computing, Big data analysis, Internet of things, Machine Learning, compute and desktop virtualization, storage and network, Software defined data centre (SDDC), RAID techniques in intelligent storage systems), after which I was given tasks for each module. I first read in-depth about each topic and thoroughly studied its concepts and applications, and then I was given a 60-minute evaluation by my monitor. The practical part was to apply a small simulation of that topic, for example, in the machine learning module, I implemented a machine learning model using regression to predict sales of a product. I also simulated a desktop virtualization. So, the instructor starts the day by checking what I did in the last day to evaluate me and give me the next task to cover theoretically and practically.   Internship Evaluation: Through this internship, I gained a variety of skills, such as how to conduct thorough research and extract relevant information about a given subject, fully comprehend the operation of storage systems, the network hierarchy from the end user to the server and all phases in between, as well as problem-solving, responsibility, and time management. Yes, this internship lived up to my expectations and motivated me to continue learning about these topics after I graduate. My GUC courses in networks, databases I and II, machine learning, embedded systems, and microprocessors were all connected to the internship tasks. I heartily endorse DELL TECHNOLOGY to all of my colleagues since it provides a wonderful opportunity to comprehend many of the technological fundamentals required in the job market.   Conclusion: In conclusion, I learned a lot while working as an intern at DELL Technology. I was successful in developing a machine learning model that predicts the product sales. I learned several things, but the most important ones are my research and time management skills. while I was an intern. I applied the skills and knowledge I gained from my GUC lecturers during my internship. The best and most advantageous features are being more familiar with the job market and how things operate there. Additionally, this gave me the opportunity to take the Dell ISM exam in the future, which will greatly benefit my career.
