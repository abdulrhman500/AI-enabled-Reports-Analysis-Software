Activities : ISM (Information storage and management) version 4 was the programme I was 
learning for my internship. To start with, I was given a brief overview of the ISM modules and subjects. 
The subjects I studied included (Cloud computing, Big data analysis, Internet of things, Machine 
Learning, compute and desktop virtualization, storage and network, Software defined data centre 
(SDDC), RAID techniqu es in intelligent storage systems), after which I was given tasks for each module. I 
first read in -depth about each topic and thoroughly studied its concepts and applications, and then I was 
given a 60 -minute evaluation by my monitor. The practical part wa s to apply a small simulation of that 
topic, for example, in the machine learning module, I implemented a machine learning model using 
regression to predict sales of a product. I also simulated a desktop virtualization. So, the instructor starts 
the day by  checking what I did in the last day to evaluate me and give me the next task to cover 
theoretically and practically.  
  
Internship Evaluation : Through this internship, I gained a variety of skills, such as how to conduct 
thorough research and extract relev ant information about a given subject, fully comprehend the 
operation of storage systems, the network hierarchy from the end user to the server and all phases in 
between, as well as problem -solving, responsibility, and time management. Yes, this internship  lived up 
to my expectations and motivated me to continue learning about these topics after I graduate. My GUC 
courses in networks, databases I and II, machine learning, embedded systems, and microprocessors 
were all connected to the internship tasks. I he artily endorse DELL TECHNOLOGY to all of my colleagues 
since it provides a wonderful opportunity to comprehend many of the technological fundamentals 
required in the job market.  
  
Conclusion : In conclusion, I learned a lot while working as an intern at DEL L Technology. I was successful 
in developing a machine learning model that predicts the product sales. I learned several things, but the 
most important ones are my research and time management skills. while I was an intern. I applied the 
skills and knowled ge I gained from my GUC lecturers during my internship. The best and most 
advantageous features are being more familiar with the job market and how things operate there. Additionally, this gave me the opportunity to take the Dell ISM exam in the future, wh ich will greatly 
benefit my career.
