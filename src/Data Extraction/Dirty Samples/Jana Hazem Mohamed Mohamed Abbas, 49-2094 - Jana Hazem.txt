 / learnt how to type in complex queries on MySQL which | already knew about in one of the semesters, so this lent a helping arm in digging deeper into MySQL. | also did small web templates using HTML, CSS which focused on the styling of the fonts and the design of the template and playing with the colors and visuals. Java also played a big part in this internship. There were a lot of problem-solving questions that my colleagues and | were supposed to finish within a specific period of time. Every time, we used Java, we were divided into groups of 2, and the supervisor monitored us to see which of the groups was able to finish all the questions in a small amount of time.
