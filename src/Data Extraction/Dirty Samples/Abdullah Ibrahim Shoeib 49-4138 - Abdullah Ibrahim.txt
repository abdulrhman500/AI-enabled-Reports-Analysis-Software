activities in csen301 course and the network course. One of the most beneficial courses that upgraded my abilities is the software course that helped get used to studying user requirements and designing a prototype frontend application for customer to have a look before implementing the oracle application In conclusion, I had a fruitful and instructive experience throughout my internship. I have learned knowledge and skills from this internship that will be very helpful in my future profession. My understanding of the work that needs to be done, my talents and skills, and the areas I wish to focus on has improved. I had the chance to meet a lot of lovely people, in addition to developing useful skills. I felt at ease at work because of the generally kind and welcoming atmosphere. I learned a lot about how my university's degree is actually offered to the market and broken down into clear departments that are all clearly tied to one another. I'm incredibly thankful to have had such a positive experience overall working with this reputable organisation and my supervisor, Mr. Khaled Kamel.
