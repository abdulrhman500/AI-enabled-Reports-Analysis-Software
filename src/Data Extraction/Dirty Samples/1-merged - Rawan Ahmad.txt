Tasks:   
The first few days of the internship period I had to go through a training process of learning the new 
technologies that I have not had background to. The very first task I had to do was to update the database in 
order to add the parents' users to the website using Typescript that I had to learn before starting the task. One of 
main task I had to do was to update some frontend pages of the websites. As well as, updating the backend in 
order to limit the number of logins for each student to limit multiple students using the same account to prevent 
students from attending a session they did not pay for. We implemented that using a QR code for each student 
that he can scan only using his mobile phone after logging in, as each student has only one login chance from 
his mobile phone.
