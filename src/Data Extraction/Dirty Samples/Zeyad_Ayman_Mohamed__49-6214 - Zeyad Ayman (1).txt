Tasks Some of the internship tasks included designing a page showing EGYPTAIR’s fleet as well as information regarding the fleet while containing the company logo, about us section, etc. using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Other tasks were concerned with analyzing EGYPTAIR’s data such as number of flights, price of tickets, and more using Microsoft Power BI to display numbers, graphs, etc. A typical working day would usually start by having a short meeting with our supervisor alongside the other interns to describe what tasks we will be doing as well as how many teams should be made or if a specific task is to be done individually. A specific day during the internship was allocated for us (all interns) to see the data center where all servers are located to show us how all data is handled and preserved by EGYPTAIR. Working with other team members / co-workers included implementing code, testing and fixing bugs and issues, making sure the UI/UX was working properly and user friendly. Most common software / technologies used during the internship included HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Microsoft Power BI.
