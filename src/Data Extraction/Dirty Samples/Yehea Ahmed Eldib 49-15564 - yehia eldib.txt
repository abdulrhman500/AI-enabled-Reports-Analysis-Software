Tasks:  
I worked as a developer  in the bank. I was assigned to some tasks to solve some bugs that emerges in the 
applications  and make new features in some ap plications  like Al A hly Net such as  making  Biometric 
authentication (F ace ID - Touch ID) to sign in  feature and also  Multiple Transfer service, which allows 
customers to make more than one (internal/domestic) transfer in one step and more rapidly . make some 
modification  in the application  UI. Also I work in some tasks on applications  that is still under production that I 
can’t reveal about it until it is published.  One of my days is that we start our day by making meeting with the 
scrum master and he discuss with u s the progress every o ne made  yesterday  and also the problems that fa ces us 
and then he begins to assign tasks to every one of the team then after the meeting every one begins t o work in 
his tasks and search in the internet for any task  he can ’t do or he can ask anyone in his team.  In some days we 
go on meeting with some clients to take their requirements  and discu ss with  them  our progress . The 
technologies  and software s that I used were java, SQL , HTML , CSS, JavaScript and  Http requests . 
Unfortunately , I can’t give more examples because most of the tasks we were  work on was on applications that 
is still under production.
