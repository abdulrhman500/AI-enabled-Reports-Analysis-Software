 In this internship, we focused on backend more than frontend as frontend was detailed more in the second internship in September. We took only a few advanced sessions and was mainly about programming languages like JavaScript, Java, C# which I already had a background about from my previous courses,however our main focus was on the task.In the task we performed, which was in group, we were told to write a backend code and we chose javascript as it is the most language I have a background of from Networks course and I also took javascript courses before. We implemented the code on visual studio code .
