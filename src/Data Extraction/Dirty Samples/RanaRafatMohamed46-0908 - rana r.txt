Tasks
I was an intern at the IT department at AHM. our role consisted of many parts. First, we would
sometimes meet up with ACT representatives and employees to integrate some parts of the solutions
they provided AHM as well as sometimes attending workshops provided by ACT that help us learn
more about the solutions as well as how to debug if we faced any problems. Second, we were in
charge of debugging and maintaining the software solutions provided by ACT such as:
Infor
SunSystems, MICROS Simphony Point-Of-Sale Restaurant Management (POS), and Opera Sales
And Catering. Finally, I was part of a team that developed a desktop app using C# that is now used by
the employees to send requests to the IT department such as requests to set up virtual machines, set
up company emails and accounts, and change account passwords. The app also keeps track of the
companyâ€™s properties given to the employees for example: Laptops, Mobile Phones, etc.
