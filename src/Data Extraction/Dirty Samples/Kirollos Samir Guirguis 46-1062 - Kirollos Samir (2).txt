Tasks: (Not less than 100 words)   The main task of this internship was to mimic an already deployed system with enhanced user interface and user experience using Angular and Microsoft SQL server. This system automated the purchase process starting from the customers' orders till packing the orders and sends them to the customers. The portal receives the order from the main website with the required components, the system then checks if the components are available at the warehouse if not the system notifies the warehouse manager with the missing components. If all the components are available at the warehouse the system then send the order to the warehouse to pack it.  Then the projects manager assigns an engineer to be responsible of the installation of the ordered components. The testing and deployment was done by the company's software development engineers, and it was not part of my internship.   Internship
