We first took sessions in networks, security, cloud computing and agile. In the last week of the internship, we  were back seating with DCSC level one Service Operations. We also joined back seating at OTB, Were we knew how networks actually work from the customer in one region to another. In addition, we saw satellite services offered by OBS in the VSAT department to serve people in remote areas and also act as a backup connection by Mohamed Kadry (Head of VSAT-COE). We also knew how receive tickets and differentiate between their types and priorities and how to contact the customer directly and solve any problem they have in the SO department by Ibrahim Mohsen (senior operations manager), Mohamed Abo Seada (Senior Operations manager) and Youssef Ezzat (Senior Technical Support Engineer). We used Oceane software to view tickets and open them. Finally, we make a presentation in a group about everything we have covered so far in the internship and presented it in front of all OBS managers.
