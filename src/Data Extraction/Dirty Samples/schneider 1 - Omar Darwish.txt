Tasks: 
 At the beginning of the internship, all of the interns attended soft skills sessions that were conducted daily 
 throughout the whole month. These sessions aimed to improve the internâ€™s soft skills in the field of work 
 and also on the personal level. Aside from these sessions, at first, I attended daily sessions with engineers 
 that are responsible of different parts of the solutions offered by the digital energy department such as 
 digital power and digital building. I understood the different products that Schneider offers in medium and 
 low voltage sections. After that, some sessions with the sales and marketing engineers were conducted in 
 order to make us understand how these products are explained and sold to clients. And now for the part 
 that is most related to my field which is software. I was exposed to multiple energy management 
 softwares that are used by Schneider Electric in its products and solutions such as the Power Management 
 Expert (PME), ETAP which belonged in the past to the company ETAP before Schneider acquired it, Planon 
 which provides integrated workplace management solutions and finally RIB which is a construction and 
 building information software that is provided  to  customers in the architecture, engineering, and real 
 estate industries.
