Tasks: In the first two weeks we were learning about different computer vision techniques and upon this knowledge we used these techniques to create a lane detection model for autonomous driving cars to detect lanes in the streets. After that we learned how machine learning works along with deep neural networks and how the AI models gets created. So as a task we created a model that detects German traffic signs from different angles. In the begging of the second month we combined the cv techniques and the machine learning knowledge to create a mini robotic car that detects and avoids humans and is controlled by hand gestures. The second part of the internship was more into the coding/development section, I developed a mobile application which is used in automating meeting rooms reservation in the Company.      Internship
