Tasks:  In the first two week s we were learni ng about different computer v ision 
techniques and upon this kn owledge we used th ese techniques to cr eate a lane detec tion model for autonomous  
driving cars to detect lane s in the streets . After that we learned how machine learning works alo ng with deep 
neural networks and how the AI m odels gets created . So as a task we created a  model that detects  German  
traffic signs  from differen t ang les. In the begging of the second m onth we combined the cv techniques and the 
machine learni ng knowledge to crea te a mini rob otic car that detects  and a voids  humans and is controll ed by 
hand gestures. The second part of the internship was more into the  coding/development sec tion, I developed a 
mobile application  which is used in automating meeting rooms rese rvation in the  Company .
