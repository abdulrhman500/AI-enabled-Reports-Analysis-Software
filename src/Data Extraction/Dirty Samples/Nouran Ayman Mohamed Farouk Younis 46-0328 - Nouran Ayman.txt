 During this internship, I was assigned to 2 main tasks The first one was to make Django app where I am able to search for students with specific grades, update the websites with students of certain grades, view all students, and sort students according to their initials or grades. In addition, I designed the webpages using html where I added buttons and tabs to make the app user- friendly. The second task was to design a small network topology including 5 routers, to assign loopback interface for each router, to design a topology that has 3 OSPF areas, and to run the SPF as an IGP with to advertise those loopbacks.
