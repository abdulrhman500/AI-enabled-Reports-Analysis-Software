Activities:   The O-project internship consists of 4 different paths including backend, react native, UI-UX, and Unity3d programs. I was choosing to be in react native program. The first 2 weeks of the internship focused on boosting our knowledge about mobile development by doing daily tasks and evaluated by our senior react native. The tasks included designing simple animated interfaces, fetching data from APIs, applying CRUD operations, navigations between screens and, generating build apk for android.  The working days were 2 days (Sunday and Wednesday) from the office and remotely rest of the week (2 days off). Also worked and learned from the rest of co-workers including backend, UI/UX and project manger helped us to understand the basics about mobile development requirements for instance, using postman to test api requests, and extracting components and svgs from xd adobe file. The internship requires some developing softwares and emulators including visual studio code IDE, postman, xd adobe and android studio. The rest of the internship focused more on developing a real software product for a client called Na7taya. Na7taya is a mobile app Arabic and English serving and connecting service providers (Sa7eb El Na7taya) with service seekers (ElNa7eet) for any type of service. Service seekers including freelancing handymen workers for instance, plumbers, electricians, carpenters, tile setters, etc. Service seekers can easily offer service seekers services they need and they can book a specific time slot depending on the free time schedule that the service providers  provides to the app. Service providers can create jobs with price and descriptions. Service seekers can search for these offers and apply for any. I was assigned for the service provider user stories including sign up, forget password, login, homepage, display and edit current/ previous offered offers, edit user information, create and edit na7aya, search and filter service seekers. A weekly meeting is set with the client and project manager to discuss the last updates and the finished user stories.

On the technical side, I have learned a lot about mobile development including, mobile design, mobile programming, data base management and application hosting. On the personal side, I got the chance to work with a fantastic team who taught me numerous collaboration skills like responsibility, communication, and patience.  The internship has exceeded my expectations because mobile development is a path that I wanted always to discover and try. Working in startup company has inspired me to open my own innovation and lunch my own company. Also the internship taught me how to work under the pressure to complete any required tasks. In the discipline of computer science, learning more about mobile design and development is essential to comprehending user experience and meeting user needs. The associated courses CSEN704 Advanced Computer Lab and CSEN603 Software Engineering were helpful in preparing for this internship. To any MET student interested in mobile development and eager to learn new skills, I would recommend this internship.  Conclusion:  The entire experience has been enjoyable at O-projects company. I was able to gain technical and personal skills, work with amazing team, and get exposure to professional world. The environment at the O-project was always welcoming, thus I felt at ease working with others. Creating creative applications, collaborating with other developers, and meeting new clients. All of my previous assignments have broadened my knowledge and brought me closer to achieving my dream career.
