Tasks:
During the 2 weeks of the internship I took courses about database optimization and 
implementing a database infrastructure using MongoDB. The choice for MongoDB was primarily for 
the reason it is a relatively simple type of  database, non-relational, that would appeal to beginners.
Optimizing the database infrastructure was performed by drawing the infrastructure as if it was a
relational database and for every relation and entity was a table or cluster created. By creating more
tables lookups would be much faster and relatively no joins in tables will be needed, which is
computationally expensive. Hence better performance of the Database.
