Tasks: 
We started by gathering the main requirements of the system and divided ourselves into teams of 3 to 4 
members, and each team of us was designing a home page using the Figma tool, then we agreed on the best 
home page design and continued working using the same color schema, and my team was assigned the 
course page design, my task here was gathering different design for the course page from best university 
websites and introducing them to my team, at the end of the first week, one of the team members come 
with different great design and we decided to divide each other into two groups to work on both designs at 
the same time and then test them to choose with which we will continue, I was a member of the first design

team, and worked on completing the design of the student's activities pages, also I gather the social media 
accounts of the different students activities and clubs at the university which is related to MET, so we can 
use the information there instead of just putting a dummy data, at the end of the design phase, I helped with 
prototyping the first design, in the third week we was divided into two teams, team to work on designing 
the EERD and the schema of the system and team to work on testing the deign, I was member of the first 
team and we brainstorm together to finialize the first draft of the EERD, then we have a meating with Dr. 
Nada Sharaf to discuss the schema and ERRD design, and after taking her comments into consideration we 
edited again, also we had time to search about MDF and NDF and how to deal with them to build our 
database, also I collected the comments we received from the design testing surveys to take them into 
consideration, at the beginning of the fourth week we had a meeting with Dr.Mervat to discuss what we 
have done so far and we planned what we will do the next weeks, and we revisited the schema again to edit 
some issues, and then we divided into teams of 2 and 3 members to start implement the frontend, I asked 
the team to let me start with one of the pages alone first so I had enough time to review HTML and learn 
CSS, and I have implemented the main parts of the course page frontend, and then Lina my teammate has 
joind me to continue working together and practise pair programming, and together we have worked on the 
followings:
- Course page (frontend: editing the header icons, adding scrolling feature to the nav bar, adding show more 
button to the syllabus section)
Same week we had a meeting with Dr. Nada to show her the progress, and she asked to start designing the 
admin and instructor views for the future and also to help us with the insertions,  as a team we brainstorm 
together the roles of both admin and instructor, and a team was responsible for designing their views on 
figma and another team was responsible for writing the admin and instructor stored procedures, I was part 
of the second team and we divided ourselves into further two teams I have worked on writing the admin 
stored procedures, then we returned back to the implementation and I worked on:
- Course page backend.
