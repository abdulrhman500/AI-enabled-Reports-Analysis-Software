Tasks : 
Conducting my internship at the IT department, I was assigned to 3 main tasks. The first task 
was to take raw data from different sources(SQL queries to capture data from the database of the 
company, Excel spread sheets and web sources) and construct the d ashboard of the IT 
department. This task was all about taking cleaning the data to help us better visualize the various big data using PowerBI and present them to the Chief Information Officer. The second 
task was to complete the requests of the guarantee system to take the portfolios from the different 
shareholders like the Central Bank of Egypt, which is the main shareholder of the company and 
other minimal shareholders like different banks such as CIB. The portfolios  system was divided  
into 2 types, the  VR portfolios and the SME portfolios. This task was mainly conducted using 
Oracle Databases. The last task was to develop a web application using Apex to better organize 
and automate the requests of the guarantees of the company.
