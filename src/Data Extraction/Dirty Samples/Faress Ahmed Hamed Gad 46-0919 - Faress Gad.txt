activities:  My working hours was 5 days a week 8 hours a day, all office based with some exceptions working remotely from home. All co-workers were cooperative and helpful and the company�s environment was amusing and joyful. At first, I was introduced to many departments to fully understand the connection of the departments together, worked with customer experience, technical team, sales and product management. I was then assigned to the Product Management department which was quite new to me, but was also a unique department as the employees within this department are responsible for knowing every single detail about the product or service because as shown in the above figure product management is the center of the company dealing with all other teams or departments. We create user stories, agile method, when dealing with end clients then discuss these user stories with the technical team dividing the required tasks or project into sprints. We also denote to the user experience department new/updated features and inform them with day-to-day changes.  At first, I was shadowing my manager, Mohanad Hossam, Product Manager at zVendo and Aya Mohamed, Product Owner to learn from their everyday tasks. Then I started researching about the features we lacked out in the company and how the top ecommerce companies utilize these features and making reports with these features and how we can utilize them in our own manner. This then lead to testing, where I became a tester for a while testing reporting and fixing all features and functionalities, such as uploading images, creating categories�etc. I also attended many meetings or �planning� as they call it for a quick task with technical team. We used C and HTML mostly.  Evaluation of Internship:  This internship exceeded my expectations, healthy environment, helpful co-workers and a whole lot of skills and experience gained. I learned to work with and within a team, learned to be punctual and to think critically, enhanced many of my technical skills and off course deal with all sorts of people. I would definitely recommend zVendo to my fellow collogues due to the specified reasons. I learned about departments that I did not know they existed, which will be mind changing when it comes to choosing a job title of field to work in. Conclusion:  I learned many things from this 3-month internship, it was definitely challenging and breath taking, but it was all worth it. I learned about the enormous field of ecommerce and to think outside the box. I am more as an Engineer and as a person. Thank You.
