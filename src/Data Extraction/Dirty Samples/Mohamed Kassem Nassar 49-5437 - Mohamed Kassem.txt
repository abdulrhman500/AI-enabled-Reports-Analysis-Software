activities I carried out were indeed correlated with my studies as the networks background I had helped me a lot and the Internship would have been much harder for me if it wasn’t for Dr. Amr El-Mogy’s network courses I had great interest into. Namely, (CSEN503) Introduction To Communication Networks and (DMET602) Network & Media lab. V. Conclusion: This internship was a great opportunity for me to experience the working life, gain interpersonal and technical skills and grow as an individual. The atmosphere at Optima Professional Services was perfect and exceeded my expectations, my coworkers were nice and friendly, we were provided by everything to keep us productive like a game room and a kitchenette with food, drinks and sweets, and everyone was helpful. In conclusion, I liked the experience, and it changed how I look at workplaces now, I would recommend this opportunity to my colleagues and to everyone who would like to get into the Networks and Cybersecurity field.
