Tasks: (Not less than 100 words)               At first in the first 2 weeks, I was asked to research scheduling techniques and see what techniques that already been introduced. Then, we start to split the system into smaller tasks to be done by everyone my task was to build the APIs and some of the Frontend logic so I had to choose the technologies I may use in my task so I started researching again about technologies like Django, Flask in python and ReactJS in the next 2 weeks. Then, I had no previous knowledge of Django or Flask so started learning about every one of them. Then, I choose to work with Django. Then the next 2 weeks, I started work on building the APIs. Then the next week, I finalized my part of the Frontend that I have in my task. Then, I worked on testing and merging the system with other teammates.  Internship
