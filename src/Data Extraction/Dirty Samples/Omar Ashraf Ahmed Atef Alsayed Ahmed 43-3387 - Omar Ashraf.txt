Tasks:  - 
 The tasks I were assigned to do during my internship at Apex Media Services 
included collecting, analyzing, and storing data to use in reports that recommend 
improvement to existing systems or processes. I also helped with setting u p new 
computers, develop and preserve local networks and software for employees to 
optimize overall system performance. I provided some support to the IT staff by processing paperwork, answering phone calls, and responding to user requests. Moreover, I ins talled and maintained different types of operating systems on the new 
computers. My tasks also included coordinating with other departments through 
online meetings to suggest solutions for handling any discovered bugs in the system and ensure that any prob lems that may occur in the infrastructure are avoided. A core 
part of my job was to maintain server stability and optimizing them to maintain the ease of application access. Furthermore, I assisted with the server security by 
monitoring them, scanning for vulnerabilities and viruses, removing any infected 
servers, and replacing them with new functioning ones. I needed to be well informed of system failures in order to provide the appropriate technical support for any 
hardware and software issues.  
Tools Used: -  
 During my time at Apex Media Services, I got the opportunity to discover and 
learn multiple new tools that provide the core for the IT industry. For example, I used 
Zabbix for monitoring the servers since it always shows the server status and send s an 
email alert if any error occurred. ConfigServer Security & Firewall (CSF) / Login 
Failure Daemon (LFD) were also used for firewall management and blocking any unauthorized or suspicious IP addresses as well Maldet which was used to detect any 
suspicio us files and move them to a specific junk folder.  Moreover, I used Rsync 
protocol for backing up the data and Ansible for configuring and deploying the servers.
