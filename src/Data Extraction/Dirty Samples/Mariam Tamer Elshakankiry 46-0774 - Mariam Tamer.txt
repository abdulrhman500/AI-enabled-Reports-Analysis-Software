activities and events such as movie nights, dish parties, and playing Paddle/Squash/Tennis matches. We’d also have weekly meetings every Sunday that start with the employees sharing their happy moments that they experienced the previous week, whether it was personal or work-related, then we’d talk about the work that needed to be done by the end of the week, and then at the very end, every employee would rate the amount of workload they were given, where red indicated that the workload was too much, and green indicated satisfaction. Any employee that gives a red rating would have another employee from the same position share this workload and help them out, or would discuss with their supervisor how this workload can be divided or organized in the best way possible to reduce the amount of stress put on the employee.  It is safe to say that I have gain a myriad of both soft and technical skills out of my participation in this internship. Regarding soft skills, I learned how to properly present myself and my work to clients, and how to give them an overview of what they’d want to see from my work, without going into the boring technical details that they may not necessarily comprehend. This has helped me gain a lot of confidence in my work, and it improved my communication skills drastically. I also learned how to properly manage my time, given the fact that I had to balance my internship with my bachelor project at some point. In addition, the exposure to an actual working environment that gives a monthly salary helped me gain a sense of responsibility and commitment, which I believe are essential to have when working in any company. Regarding the technical competences, my debugging skills improved radically during my stay in Coberg, as well as my familiarity with Salesforce’s framework and environments. Data Structures and Algorithms, Databases I and II, Semester 7’s ACL, and Analysis and Design of Algorithms are all examples of the courses I took in GUC that were related to my internship; and the knowledge that I gained out of them aided me throughout my internship journey. I also used a lot of the Design Principles that were discussed in the Software Engineering course when it came to designing the Salesforce org for the clients. Hence, this internship has definitely met my expectations, and has even greatly exceeded them, and I recommend this internship to all GUC MET students.  To wrap up, the experience I gained from this internship was incredibly beneficial, and it has helped be grow individually as a person, and it broadened my insights on how the workplace environments generally behave, and I believe this will help me in the future when I take on a job position that I can get promoted in. It gave me a taste of working in a team that shares a common goal to overcome challenges and benefit the company, as well as overseeing my time and deciding to spend it wisely so as not to fall behind neither in university, nor in the company. I largely appreciate how Coberg prioritizes its employees and acknowledges their efforts, as I believe that the most important asset of any company is its employees. So long as the employees are satisfied and comfortable with the work environment, their results are sure to help flourish the company, and Coberg is well aware of that and handles this perfectly, which is the top reason why I respect this company and recommend it to all of my colleagues.
