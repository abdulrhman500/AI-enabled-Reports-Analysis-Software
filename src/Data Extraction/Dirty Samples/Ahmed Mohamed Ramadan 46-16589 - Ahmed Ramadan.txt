Tasks:During this internship, I worked on an e-commerce application called Green Corner. My work in the internshipcan be divided into three parts. The first part is front-end development using Kotlin and android studio, thesecond part includes UI/UX work and The third part is back-end development, which was done using C#,Microsoft Dot Net core, dapper and entity framework. While the previously mentioned parts are of courseimplemented for every feature, most of the time I haven’t done all the parts for the same feature, meaning that,for example, I have worked on the front-end part only for some features and the same goes for other parts.

The UI/UX part was mostly done with the front end part, However, on somepages, I have made changes to the UI without any changes in functionality, such as for example changing thecolour of some tabs and changing the shape of some icons like the search and cart icons. I have also suggested adesign of the UI/UX of some pages with new features using Figma. As for the back end part, I have worked onnew features, one feature was for the patients to upload the prescription to the application, where theprescription should be saved in the application’s database and be associated with the customer. Also, there areoptions for the customer to retrieve, edit, or delete his/her previous prescriptions uploaded. I have used an entityframework to work with the database, as the approach used was code-first.These are some screenshots from the application during different stages of development:When observing the leftmost and the middle photos, for example, there are some changes in the upper tab thatcan be observed. In the upper tab (fixed on all pages), the colour of it has been changed, the theme of the iconshas changed and there were some features added such as the heart (go to favourites page) and the menu buttonon the left which on click shows the sidebar menu. The rightmost picture shows the feature of selecting acategory from the left sidebar menu and a subcategory from the right. These are other examples of my front-endand UI/UX work.5Student Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; EgyptInternship
