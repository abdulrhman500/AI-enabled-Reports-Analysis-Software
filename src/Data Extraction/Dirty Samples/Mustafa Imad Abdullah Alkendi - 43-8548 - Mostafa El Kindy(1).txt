Tasks:
To develop smart contracts,
Solidity , a programming language akin to
JavaScript, is employed. The code of the smart contract is completely immutable, or unchangeable. This assures
that all network nodes ensure the data's safety and immutability . Using Ganache as our own blockchain for
Ethereum development. It is a distributed network, which means that all participants are responsible for the
network's operation. We also utilised the Truffle Framework, which provides a set of tools for constructing
Ethereum smart contracts in Solidity . We also utilised the Truffle Framework, which provides a set of tools for
constructing Ethereum smart contracts in Solidity and providing a client side application built using The Truffle
framework and React js. here are the task performed throughout the internship process:
●
Smart Contract Management which entails creating smart contracts in the Solidity programming
language and compiling them into bytecode for execution on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
●
Automated Testing which entails writing tests against your smart contracts to guarantee that they
function as expected. These tests may be written in JavaScript or Solidity and executed on the
Truffle-configured network.

Deployment and migrations which entails writing scripts that migrate and deploy smart contracts to the
company's Ethereum blockchain network.
●
Client Side Development which utilizes Configuring the truf fle project to host client side applications
built with react js that communicate with the blockchain-deployed smart contracts.
