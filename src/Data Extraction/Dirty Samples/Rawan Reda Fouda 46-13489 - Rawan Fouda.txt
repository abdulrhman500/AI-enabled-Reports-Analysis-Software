Company information: company's history, mission, and relevant links.2. Internship description: assigned internship tasks, working conditions, working tools.3. Overview of internship experience: internship evaluation (skills gained, impact on futureplans, etc.) and conclusion.Company Description:Jumia was built with a mission to help consumers access millions of goods and servicesconveniently and at the best prices, while opening up a new way for sellers to reach consumersand grow their businesses. It is built around a marketplace, Jumia Logistics, and JumiaPay. Themarketplace helps millions of consumers and sellers to connect and transact. Jumia Logisticsenables the delivery of millions of packages through our network of local partners. JumiaPayfacilitates the payments of online transactions for Jumia's ecosystem. With over 1 billion peopleand 500 million internet users in Africa, Jumia believes that e-commerce is making people's liveseasier by helping them shop and pay for millions of products at the best prices wherever theylive. Jumia was launched in Nigeria in 2012 and has expanded to five other countries: Egypt,Morocco, Ivory Coast, Kenya, and South Africa. It continued to expand to other Africancountries, and by 2018, it was present in 14 African countries.  Jumia’s strategic goal is to be thenumber one shopping destination for Africans.mailing address: https://group.jumia.com/contactlink: https://group.jumia.com/Internship descriptionAs a large company registered on the stock exchange, Jumia has to deal with SOX compliance.For that, they need to demonstrate that they have procedures in place to guarantee that there is noloss of information between Jumia systems. Entity Diff is an application that compares twoentities and returns the results back to a JSON file and sends this as a notification to a slackchannel. However, with the increased number of systems under the scope of SOX compliance,the workload to extract all the evidence has also increased. The Entity Diff web app (Edie) wasthe project idea of our internship to create a separate web app that builds upon the standaloneEntity Diff app to enhance the process of generating evidence, making it more efficient.During the working days, I was working with a fellow intern on building EDiE under theguidance of our manager, Jorge, and was following the Agile methodology with team FOX underthe finance department that is responsible for creating and managing finance tools. The team wasdiverse and I have dealt with several engineers from Portugal. My supervisors, Carlos and Jorge,were Portuguese. Throughout the working days, daily standups were conducted during which wediscussed what we worked on and the next steps. The internship duration was 4 months. Theinternship was hybrid in nature, but for the most part, remote. The first two months werepart-time (20 hours/week) and the other 2 months were full-time (40 hours/week). A typicalfull-time working day  would start from 9 am to 6 pm for 5 days a week.  For each task, I wasassigned a ticket on Jira and the progress of the task was tracked. Once a task is completed, apull request is created on GitHub, reviewed by other team members, and merged upon approval..In the first two months, I had several online orientations about Jumia departments and onlinemeetings with product owners and chief managers, explaining how the departments in Jumiafunction and the logistics for each department. I was introduced to the project, then starteddiscussing the project requirements, constructing the database model, and setting up docker andthe project on GitHub. I was also familiarizing myself with Spring Boot framework,implementing some code, learning about its architecture and how to work with it.In the next 2 months, I was mainly working on the backend side of the project. The structure ofthe project required working with mainly 4 layers: data, domain, network, and API. Thisinvolved creating the database schema on PostgreSQL as part of the data layer, writing the logicbehind each function call in the domain layer, developing a micro-services-based applicationusing Java Spring Boot that involved implementing controllers and services for handling APIcalls, writing unit tests using Junit in each layer, implementing a pagination service to allow forbulk retrieval, filtering and sorting of records, as well as integrating the web application withexternal systems, such as Jira to create tickets if needed without human intervention.After developing some of the core backend structure, I started working on the front end usingAngular 2+. This involved retrieving database records and displaying them in Angularmaterial-UI tables, adding a filtering option to allow users to filter by columns, adding a sortingoption to allow users to sort by columns, adding a search option to allow users to search by text,creating buttons to allow users to add as well as update rows, implementing actions that uponuser selection, the user can view additional row details on a sidebar.The code was regularly reviewed and, accordingly, adjustments were made to the website.During my internship period, I also had an onsite visit to Jumia’s warehouse in the 5thSettlement where I learned about the process that order items undertake before finally reachingthe customer. This includes how items are picked if they are stored in Jumia’s warehouse,consolidated, and sent to a Jumia provider that is chosen by a ranking system that finally shipsthe order to the customer. Furthermore, I learned about the process a returned order goes throughin the After Sales department before accepting/rejecting the return request.Internship
