Tasks:  During the internship we were working in teams where each team was responsible for a certain task and then we integrated the different parts together. The aim of the project was to be able to remotely drive the self-driven car (SDC) from the VR lab using the virtual reality headset. First, I was part of the team that was working on displaying the camera feed in virtual reality. So we had to search and explore how we can use unity, a cross-platform game engine, developed to display the feed in VR. After some work, we managed to find a way to capture the computer screen and display it in unity to be later shown in VR. Then, we joined the team that was working on establishing a communication between the SDC and the PC in the VR lab to help explore the different possible ways we can send and receive the camera feed along with the other controls needed for the car orientation and movement. After managing to establish the needed communication and locally test all the features integrated together. We tried the prototype to evaluate its performance and see where we have a room for improvement for the next model. In the second phase our main goal was to improve the quality of the communication by working on reducing the delay. Also we wanted to improve the overall quality of the users experience so we added a back camera, wide angle camera (to help have a better view of the sidewalks) and finally we added distance leaders, used to warn the user if anything is approaching from a blind spot not covered by the cameras. Also we made some improvement on the user interface to account for the new added features and make the interface more user friendly .To make the users have a more realistic experience we 1 Student Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt        worked alongside with a team of mechatronics students that were developing haptic gloves that have different levels of vibration that help the user have a feedback on the road he is currently driving on and a taste of the surrounding environment. At the end of the internship, we tested the updated prototype and it was a success.  Internship
