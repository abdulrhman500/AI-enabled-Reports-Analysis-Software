 My internship performed task was to research in a lot of topics around machine learning and neural networks field beginning from beginner level like how to train simple machine learning model for classification to advanced level like implementing a multilayer artificial neural networks from scratch passing be learning alot of scimitar learn and how to build good training datasets and classifying images with convolutional neural networks.
