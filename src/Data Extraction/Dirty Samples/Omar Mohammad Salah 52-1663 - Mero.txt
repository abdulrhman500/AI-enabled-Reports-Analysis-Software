Implementing New Library Management System  
 
This library management system was rebuilt to be able to introduce new features and functionalities. 
In order to do so, I needed to start by designing the database schema to efficiently store all the data. It 
had to be easy to modify and maintain. A good design will always lead to easy retrieval of information 
which is important in any system. The next step was to apply the d ata normalization rules to make sure 
that the tables are structure d correctly. Once I was done with the database part, I needed to add 
classes to build the objects as well as building the driver class to connect the database to the rest of 
the code. I also  had to add a builder class that builds the permissions on who can access the system. 
Once the backend part was done, I had to work on the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
