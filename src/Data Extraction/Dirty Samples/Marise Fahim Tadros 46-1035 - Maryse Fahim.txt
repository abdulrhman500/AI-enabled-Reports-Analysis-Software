tasks:
Before beginning the internship activities, we had a look at the various web
development frameworks and when each one should be used. In order to introduce us to the
world of software development, which demands the mastery of problem-solving techniques,
we also conducted problem-solving exercises.
The following phase involved choosing the framework for a web development project
that had been assigned to us. We chose to utilise strapi for the backend and next js for the
frontend.I was working on two tasks simultaneously because it was my first time to use strapi: I
was learning strapi and conducting research while analysing the database to determine the
entities and the relationships among them. During this phase I was seeing the practical use of
the database course that we studied in semester 5 and put it to use. We also had regular
meetings with the team working on the frontend to share our progress together .
Later on, after I had learned more about strapi and had a good understanding of the
database, my task was to create the tables using strapi and add the attributes. The crucial step
that connects the frontend and backend—and ultimately ties everything together—came next.
