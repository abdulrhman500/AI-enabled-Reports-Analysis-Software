Tasks:In this internship, I was tasked to handle the CCTV cameras as well as the database it stores the data on. So I would check thecameras in each cluster and make sure they were working correctly, and that they were in the correct location, looking at the correctangle and making sure they did not have any objects obscure the view. Since the CCTV system was a Huawei one, I was usingHolosens and E-Sight to make sure the CCTV system was working as intended. As for the database, all of the footage that thecameras captured were stored on a local server which then a powerful PC analized the raw data using computer vision and machinelearning to detect, recognize and identify certain objects such as people, license plates, animals, etc. This data is then stored back onthe server. What I had been tasked with is to create queries to place this data in the correct table so theyâ€™d be easily fetched whenneeded.Internship
