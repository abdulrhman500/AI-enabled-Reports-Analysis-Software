Tasks:  (Not less than 100 words)  At Coligo, we worked in an Agile environment where we had 1-week sprints, and daily 15 minutes standups to  share our progress in the sprint with the rest of the team. Every Sunday, I participated in the sprint planning  session where the team got together to divide user stories into smaller tasks, give time estimates on how long  these tasks will take, and add these tasks to the sprint backlog. The Backend project followed Microservices  architecture, that's why I used various different frameworks and technologies, which were NodeJs (Express),  MongoDB, Golang, PostgreSQL, NATS, and Docker. Most of the tasks I had were to develop and add new  endpoints to the API using Nodejs/Golang with the needed authentication, authorization, and validations that  meet the business requirements. Then, after creating the endpoint, I needed to implement unit and integration  tests using Jest and  Mocha, and I also needed to write documentation(docs) for the new endpoint using  Swagger. Other tasks I had were to fix bugs in the system reported either by the Testing team or users while  using the system. Also, some tasks were to introduce third-party software (e.g NATS, AWS S3) to the system  which was done by setting up the configuration for the Software Development kit (SDK), and editing the  Dockerfile if needed. There were also some tasks to refactor a service or a unit test by breaking it into smaller  functions that can be used in more than one service or test. Another responsibility I also had was reviewing  other team members' pull requests on Github, so that I can point out anything they have missed in the code, test,  or docs.  4  Student Career & Alumni Development Office.  scad@guc.edu.eg  | German University in Cairo  New Cairo City - Main  Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt  Internship
