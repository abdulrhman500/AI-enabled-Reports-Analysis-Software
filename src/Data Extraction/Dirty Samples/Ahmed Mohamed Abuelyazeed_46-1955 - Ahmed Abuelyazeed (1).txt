Tasks: (Not less than 100 words)     As part of my internship, I worked on various tasks using different technologies and platforms, which enabled me to acquire new skills and learn new things continually. I worked as a front-end web developer with three other colleagues. Our task was to create GRID, a website that shares events and news about FinTech. Through AdobeXD, the design team provided us with the design and layout. The internship was split into three different parts; the first was HTML/CSS, the second was ReactJS, and the third was accessibility. A team leader assisted us with each task during the internship. Every working day, our team lead/supervisor and I held a group meeting to discuss our tasks or newly assigned tasks, and we had to estimate how long it would take to complete them.  We first had to set up the project structure using SASS to make the project readable and easy to understand. Then each of us worked on his part separately. There were different sections to be delivered by each member of the team. As my first task, I was responsible for creating and styling reusable component cards with 4 Student Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt        a top image and text underneath that would be used multiple times on the website using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap.    As part of my task, I created the footer, articles, and events section on the main page and their inner pages. I had to first create a layout for each section using HTML, then start to style each section using Bootstrap and CSS and make sure that everything was precisely the same as the design given. Moreover, I had to ensure that the website was responsive across multiple devices. Using a mobile-first design approach, I began developing the website for mobile devices and worked my way up to larger devices such as tablets and desktops.    The most challenging task was to create the carousel/slider in each section. A carousel is a website element that displays information that can slide or fade. To do this, I used an API called Swiper, which offers a variety of mobile sliders. The tricky part was manipulating the Swiper sliders' layout and design to match the design of the slider on our website.     After that, we started integrating ReactJS into our code. I turned each section I created using HTML into a reusable React component using JSX. Then we started working on the accessibility of the website. We needed to ensure that people with disabilities could use the website. My tasks were to work on keyboard accessibility and dark mode. Some people with specific disabilities rely solely on the keyboard to navigate a website. I made the website easy to navigate for users and screen readers using the tab button on the keyboard through vanilla Javascript. This allows the user the navigate the whole website using only the keyboard. The other task was to ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������    Regarding the working conditions during the internship, the typical working day was from 9-5. It was a hybrid job; on some days, I worked from home, and on others, I went to the office. My colleagues, supervisors, and I communicated through Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Outlook. As for the code version control, we used Azure DevOps.   Internship
