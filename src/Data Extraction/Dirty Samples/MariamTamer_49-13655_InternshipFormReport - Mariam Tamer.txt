activities In the internship, I was assigned to understand IoT Hardware Trojans, research and find their types, build them on Logisim using circuit components, then implement them on Quartus Prime, and lastly test it on an FPGA board. The internship was 4 weeks, with an online meeting with Dr. Hassan Soubra every Tuesday at 12:00 pm, and sometimes we needed an extra meeting which was on Thursday, my colleague Farah Afifi helped me with the research and making the references for the papers we used. She took a certain type of trojan and worked with it which was sequential, while I took the combination.  My working day was 5-hour working including research, writing code and building a circuit. I used Logisim, Logisim evolution, Quartus Prime 20.1 and an FPGA Board. The research was the hardest phase of the internship for me because at the beginning I was using the wrong keywords to find good and relevant papers to get the information from but then I was able to find really good papers when I changed the keywords as Dr. Soubra told me to do and with the help from Farah.          3.
