tasks:        I was covering the ecommerce industry from multiple perspectives first is the website and it is shopify based and I worked on the backend of it, checking the codes and integrating the website with the ERP system, while maintaining the right dispatching process, right order handling process, right sales process, and right UX/UI design as well.   1- Helping in order fulfilment on the website on daily basis, handling more than 500 orders/day.  2- Maintaining stock availability on the website backend.  3- Editing the code of the checkout features and website UI.  4- Helping in website integrations with shopify app and the 3rd party apps and most importantly the ERP integration with the shopify app.  Conclusion:           I learned a lot from this internship, some of the things I learned is how to work with a team and solve real-life problems in a company with critical problems for example:  to update the system and add new items and for the website to always be available and running properly, receiving orders and updating stock. Technical skills: UI experience, checkout page optimization, Odoo ERP System integration, Shopify App API, and logistics and ecommerce operations. This internship helped me know how real projects work and how tasks are divided and what to expect, I think I learned new things but most similar to the SE Course.
