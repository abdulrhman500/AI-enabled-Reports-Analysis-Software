Tasks:  (Not less than 100 words)  
 
Throughout  my first month,  I was introduced  through  sessions  about  python  basics  to develop  our skills,  and 
then we were  given  sessions  about  Django  that were  very beneficial  as our instructors  were  very helpful,  they 
went  through  deep  details  about  Django,  with an assignment  at the end of each session  to asses  our amount  of 
understanding,  we were  also shown  the professional  working  life and how they handle  all the team  work  and 
their tasks.  During  the second  month  we were  introduced  to real projects, as I was given  the assignment  to 
develop  a website  for the company  using  Django,  with the participation  of other  interns,  under  the supervision  
of our instructors,  a list has been  made  for us with all the project  requirements  to assure  developing  the website  
in the best form.  As for the third  month,  another  assignment  has been  assigned  to us, which  was developing  a 
software  tool to be implemented  in the website  based  on the COBIT2019  toolkit  (Designing  an Information   
and Technology  Governance  Soluti on), the toolkit  (using  python)   was based  on taking  an evaluation  from  
managers  for their companies  (one company  at a time)  for all its departments  ( IT, HR,..)  and based  on a 
database  that we created  (taken  from  the COBIT2019  design  guide  toolkit)  we were allowed  to generate  outputs  
that shows  which  department  needs  to be assisted  and revised.  Moreover,  in the third  month,  we were  also 
introduced  to IBM OpenPages,  and we were  assigned  to do a presentation  (as a team  of interns)  to our
