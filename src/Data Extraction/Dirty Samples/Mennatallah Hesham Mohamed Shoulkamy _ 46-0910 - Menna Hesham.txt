Tasks             For six weeks, I worked as an intern at DELL Technologies. During the first four weeks, we learned about a variety of topics from several Dell teams, including the TechDev team, the DevOps team, the Tech support team, the 5G team, the Artificial intelligence team, the Server and Storage team, the Sales and PreSales team, the HR team, and many more. Every team discussed what they do, the softwares they use, and we even tried some of these softwares. We also attended sessions regarding soft skills such as presentation skills, CV writing, communication skills, design thinking, emotional intelligence, and interview preparation. Some sessions included tech talks in which individuals came to share their career paths and success stories till they reached senior management at Dell. We also took two courses, ISM and CIS, which were taught by company instructors. Finally, over the last two weeks, we were divided into teams to come up with an idea using technology to affect human progress, following the design thinking steps and developing the business model, marketing plan, studying the best fit softwares for the development , and a prototype, which we will present on the final day in front of three judges and some attendees, who will provide feedback. My team proposed creating a social media app that encourages individuals to connect in person rather than chatting or calling each other. The app basically reminds users that they should meet up with someone on their friend list today because they haven't seen them in a long time, and then it gives them ideas of where they could go out and what activities they could do, as well as discounts at these places. The screenshots from the figma prototype for the app, for which I was responsible, are attached in the Appendices section. Internship
