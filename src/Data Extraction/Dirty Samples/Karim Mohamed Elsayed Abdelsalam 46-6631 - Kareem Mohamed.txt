 Several tasks was done during this internship. To start with, the internship was about remote driving a car using a VR (virtual reality) headset using unity and my main task in the internship was to make a haptic feedback glove that mimics the road vibrations in order to give a realistic feeling of driving in the drivers hand when driving the car using the VR controllers. The gloves where made by using two fabric gloves for each hand, for the first glove, 8 micro vibrators where installed on it operated by a motor driver which is controlled by an Arduino Uno code. Then, all the micro vibrators where covered by the second glove. After that, on the car side, an accelerometer was placed to measure the rigidity of the road so that of the road has low rigidity only 4 of the vibrators will start to vibrate and if the rigidity was high all the vibrators will vibrate. The data was send from the car to the Arduino Code by the means of a python code.
