 Internship task was to digitalize the company's job order by proposing and introducing an online e-commerce website. The internship location was their headquarters in Obour city, with a few sprint meetings done through Microsoft Teams and Zoom or face to face. Throughout the entire project, I used HTML, CSS, NodeJS, and React, all on Visual Studio Code to implement a website layout proposal. My researches included looking for issues/troubles in each department, analyzing every problem and seeing how some problems may be solved with the proposed e-commerce, studying the job descriptions of the departments to see how some of their work can be integrated into the website, and used Photoshop and Illustrator for creating the proposed website wireframes.
