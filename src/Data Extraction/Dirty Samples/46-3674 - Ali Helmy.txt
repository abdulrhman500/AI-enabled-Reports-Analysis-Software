Tasks: 
The internship programme has three primary components. The initial step was to connect the laptop that uses 
VR to the car , such as by receiving sensor and video feeds from the vehicle. The second method involved giving 
the car commands like steer , accelerate, and brake via a cloud. The VR controllers, which were programmed to 
communicate with the car , are what send these commands. 
The final component of the haptic gloves is what simulates driving an automobile. The gloves received specific 
information from the car via a cloud and translated it to various vibration levels depending on the road
conditions and the motion of the car . 
The interns were given dif ferent parts to work on, and we all collaborated because each aspect is interconnected.
