Tasks:
(Not less than 100 words) 
The internship was decided into two parts: Artificial intelligence and software development. During the first 
month we learned about Artificial intelligence through a series of lessons each followed by a task. First we 
learned about computer vision, a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand
the visual world. After understanding what it is we were asked to do a task which was to write a python code 
using OpenCV  library to detect the lanes in a picture of a road. The goal was to understand the way self driving 
cars detect road lanes. Task 2 was basically an enhancement of task 1 in which the results were more detailed 
and accurate. After computer vision we shifted our focus to machine learning and deep neural networks. We 
were asked to create a neural network which detects handwriting and another that detects road signs. Finally we
created a self-driving car that detects people and moves away from them. In the second part of the internship we
created a system to manage the company's resources. In the process of building this system I had two roles: a
backend developer and a scrum master , a manager right under the project manager in an agile environment.
