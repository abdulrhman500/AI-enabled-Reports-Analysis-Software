activities are correlated to my studies and one can argue that is an extension to the theory I learn in lectures at the GUC. The internship offers insight about how multi-national companies actually work with big data and at a very large data generation rate. Some courses that helped are Software Engineering and Databases 2.   I would recommend Orange to engineering students as my to my personal experience was very positive. However, the satisfaction can vary from team to team and depends a lot about the supervisor you are paired with.   In conclusion, my internship at Orange Egypt was very beneficial from a technical standpoint, as well as the non-technical side of things. I was given the opportunity to work in a very interesting task to me that was quite challenging and that I enjoyed. The telecommunication industry is a great industry for engineers who are interesting about big data, data analysis and machine learning.
