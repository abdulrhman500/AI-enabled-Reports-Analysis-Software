Tasks:                                                                                                     My internship was full stack web development of a website (MET website) the aim was to present a full functioning website for the MET department for the professors, TAs, students and admins, I worked with my colleges as a web development team of that website using the ASP.Net technology, we followed the agile methodology as team, so first we would manage ourselves as a team, distribute the tasks among us next we collect our work, then review by the end of every week and present it to our supervisor Prof. Mervat Abuelkheir, we had a git repository for the website so we all can have access to the project’s latest version and work together smoothly. First my tasks were getting the functional and non-functional requirements of the project.  Second was the designing of the website, I used Figma to design the UI/UX by making prototypes and wire-frames of the website, I presented two different designs for the website to choose from I designed the courses page, the student activities’ pages (Incubator/ACM GUC brain/GDG/IEEE/SAVVY), the home page and the lecturers/TAs profile pages(These were the pages that I continued my following tasks on),  then the supervisor and us decided to go for the second design,                                                                                                                                       Third, I did a EERD diagram for the database, after it was approve I used mdf and SQL technologies to represent it in visual studio and to create the tables that will hold the data of the users, procedures and queries, then it was review by Dr. Nada Sharaf and Dr. Mervat to be modified and perfected to match the actual schema of the database of the old website, Fourth was to convert these Figma frames into its HTML and CSS code, it was written from scratch without any conversion tools from Figma in addition to adding some features and animation to them, which required a lot of searching process. Fifth was to implement the backend of these HTML/CSS pages using C# and JavaScript languages and implementing the authentication processes like sending an email of verification to the user in case he/she forgot their password and the mechanism of the searching bar, all of which was searched for and I’ve learned so much in the process. Finally, was to implement the admin point of view of website from where he can administrate the users’ behaviors, passing again by of the five stages of the website from frontend till the backend.
