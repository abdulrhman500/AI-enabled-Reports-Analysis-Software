However, my major goal was to put what I had learned into practise \nand observe how the real world functions. The description, history, and founding of the company are covered in the \nfirst section. The tasks I was given to complete, the technologies I used, how I was able to complete the task on time, \nhow the company operates internally, how the employees work in terms of software development and soft skills, and \nfinally how computer science operates in the industry are all described in the second section. \nSecurity service provider Salus Lab (https://saluslab.net/), based in Dubai and serving the MENA, was established in \n2017. Enterprise customers in the MENA Region can benefit from Salus Lab\'s expertise in three key areas: \ninformation security, security awareness, and professional training. The Roman goddess of safety "Salus" inspired the \nname Salus Lab. We will guarantee the safety and security of your business using our knowledge in the area. The \ncompany\'s objective is to offer software (Demeter-API) that will enhance the security of your code and the general \nsecurity of your networks by giving you instructions on how to build highly secure code. Email for the business is \ninfo@saluslab.net. \nIn order to grasp and study the differences between these 2 technologies, we the backend internship team was given \nthe task of refactoring code from elastic search to axios.Know when to utilise each, and develop secure, highly \nefficient programmes. This task duration We had four weeks to refactor the entire product and learn axios and elastic \nsearch. \nSecond, we were given a three week project to develop a REST API utilising three different technologies: Fastify for \nthe server, Elastic-Search for the database, and Axios for the interface between the two so that requests could be sent \nand received.Additionally, we used VScode to write the code and Postman to send and receive queries while we \ntested that API. \nThirdly, we were tasked with documenting the entire project\'s code, endpoints, and API for 4 weeks so that the \nfrontend team could comprehend the endpoints we established as well as how future customers and users should use \nthe product. We utilised swagger and the open source tools Spotlight.io (https://www.spotlight.io) and Spotlight.io \n(https://swagger.io) for this assignment. \nFourthly, we were required to use a programme called NodeJSScan (https://github.com/ajinabraham/nodejsscan) a \nstatic code analyzer for the last two weeks of the course , which allows you to upload your code and checks it for \n\x0c6 \nStudent Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt \n \n \nsecurity before returning any issues, warnings, or vulnerabilities that could result in low security. In order to examine \nthe code, make it even better, and eliminate those flaws and faults, we were instructed to utilise that programme and \nrun it on the software. Additionally, we had to download a VM (virtual machine) using Docker for that tool to operate \non in order to use it and learned about docker. \nWe had daily scrum meetings every day at 10 AM to discuss what we learned, receive tasks, offer us instructions to \ndirect us to the right route, and ultimately, discuss today\'s work and yesterday\'s successes and problems because the \ncompany uses an agile workflow methodology. Since all tasks were team-based, we divided the entire workload \namong us for each task. During the meetings, we tried to problem-solve collectively and come up with alternate \nsolutions to the problems we encountered. More importantly, though, we synchronised the work to ensure that \neverything was operating as it should. We utilised VSCODE to code, Postman to test and ensure the functionality of \nour work, and NODEJSCAN to check for security when using the tools and technologies. the use of Elastic-Search, \nAxios, and Fastify and done mini projects with it. For us to finish the tasks in time we had to work every day from \n10am to 6pm as we start the day by our daily meeting. \nAfter my internship, I gained knowledge on how to develop cleaner, more efficient code. In addition, how to control \nthe network\'s, code\'s, and software\'s security (All main security issues). Furthermore, because I had to work in teams \nduring my internship, I enhanced my teamwork abilities. Along with developing these skills, I also learned a variety \nof new tools and technologies that I\'ll undoubtedly use to produce better code in the future. The internship did live up \nto my expectations because I\'ve always wanted to learn how to design code that is more streamlined and safe while \nyet maintaining performance. Prior to the internship, I was interested in pursuing a career in Web development or \ntesting. However, following the internship, I have additional career options. Software-Engineering 603 was the course \nthat benefited me the most during my internship since it forced me to grasp the agile approach and the stages of the \ndevelopment process, starting with design and ending with testing. Additionally, all computer science classes aided \nwith the efficiency (performance) and problem-solving portions of the code. \nLast but not least, that was my first experience with anything security-related, and learning certain adjustments to the \ncode and the tools that increased my general problem-solving and coding skills was incredibly enjoyable (security and \nefficiency). The experience was really beneficial, and it will undoubtedly affect the way I write code, how I make \ndecisions in the future, and ultimately how I think. Additionally, I will undoubtedly incorporate cyber-security into \nmy future job strategy. The company hierarchy and the duties of each function, from intern to senior developer, have \nalso been taught to me; this will be helpful. In addition, I\'ve gotten a lot of advice and criticism that will shape my \nfuture decisions and work. \n\x0c7 \nStudent Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0c8 \nStudent Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCertificate of Completion \nSalus Lab \n \nOmar Sherif Ali Hassan \n \n \n \nFor Completing Salus Lab Internship Program \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMINA GHALY \nCo- Founder \n \n \n \n \n'
