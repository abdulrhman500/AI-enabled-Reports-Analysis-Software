b'\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0cOmar Mohamed Hussein \nMET \n46-1632 \n1 \n \nInternship Report \n \nThe following report will outline my 3-month internship starting in June and \nending in September, working for Pc Power. During the course of this internship, I have \ncome to acquire a new skillset to be added to my arsenal. Taking this internship was an \neye opener for me; since, I could have not predicted the number of diverse jobs and \nopportunities available for a Media Engineering Technology graduate. Before taking on \nthis challenge, I was set out to explore all the different jobs that I could find, so I can \neventually choose my own career path. Hence, why my intern position in Pc Power was \na totally different field of work than my chosen Bachelor Thesis topic. During the course \nof this report, I will give a concise description of Pc Power and moreover, present a \nhandful of tasks I was assigned to. Finally, I would summarize my experience in the \nworkplace and highlight my new skills. \n \n \nFounded in 1994, Pc Power is now one of the leading solutions and service \nproviders, offering their services in Egypt and the Middle East. Their main mission is to \nprovide their clients with state-of-the-art IT solutions, consultant and technical services, \nthat are cost effective, mobile and scalable. They also fill the market gap of providing \ncustomers with various solutions and services in ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), \nCRM (Custom Relationship Management), business management and web services. \nMoreover, as of 2022, they have become an official Odoo GOLD partner. This is due to \nthe fact that not Odoo has become the crown jewel of their methods and strategies to \noffer clientele solutions.  \n \n \nSelected as an intern Odoo developer, I was set out to work with a program that I \nnever heard about prior to this experience; hence, the first month of the internship. In \nthe beginning, I would join in online meetings and courses so I could recognize and \nunderstand the firm\xe2\x80\x99s values and method of work. I was introduced to other intern \ndevelopers and implementors and we commence to learn Odoo. The software\xe2\x80\x99s biggest \nadvantage that it is so widely known; thus, there is a ton of documentation and tutorials \nonline to familiarize with the software\xe2\x80\x99s features and how to use it to my advantage. I \nhave come to learn that its easy to use, minimalistic UI software is one of the main \nreasons it was so popular worldwide. Not only can developers easily navigate its \nfeatures and code, but people without technical background can also maneuver its \nproperties and system with ease of use. Moreover, it is so flexible in the sense that it is \nan open-source software, allowing developers like myself to tailor the program to the \nclient\xe2\x80\x99s needs. In my second month, I worked under an Odoo consultant; since, I was \n\x0cOmar Mohamed Hussein \nMET \n46-1632 \n2 \n \nsolely focused on the technical side of the job. I was instructed to create and calculate \nnew fields for the ongoing client projects. I also managed to customize Odoo by creating \nnew modules and features within the software itself, utilizing its open-source code. \nFurthermore, I was challenged with expanding my Python coding capabilities; since, I \nmainly used python to understand and eventually alter the source code. In my third \nmonth, I was more hands on in the work experience, as I was also working with a junior \ndeveloper and a consultant with other clients. A lot of meetings were conducted with the \nclient, which I have participated in, and I have been introduced to the business side of \nworking as an Odoo developer. Although I was not required to become more business \nminded as a developer, it was definitely insightful as I now know more business features \nI can add and develop while working on my Odoo application. Moreover, I have worked \non adding constraints, linked modules with one another using inheritance, implemented \naction buttons, improved security in my project by working with csv files and finally, \nlearnt how to polish my code; since, it was important my code is organized and easy to \nunderstand as, I am working with other developers, and this was a team project. \n \n \nThroughout this internship, I have gained a lot of new skills. At first, I was \nintroduced to ERP system, as I have never been aware of its existence. I knew what it \nwas like to work in a team environment and how important it is to be able to \ncommunicate my ideas, using words, presentations and even accommodate my coding \nstyle for the better understanding of my coworkers. I dove deeper into coding with \npython; which is arguably one of the best languages in development. This was also my \nfirst time into incorporating business ideas in my projects and opened my eyes into what \nmy future line of work could be; incorporating developing skills and business plans. I \nhave learnt how to communicate with clients, absorb information and capture their \nattention. Ultimately, I realized the extent of what Odoo can do to help the growth of \nsmall and medium organizations. I believe the CSEN courses have definitely assisted \nmy work and comprehension in this internship. Moreover, I was relieved to find how my \nprojects in the Databases courses were able to benefit me in constructing new fields \nand elements in the Odoo software. \n \n \nIn drawing things to a close, I firmly believe this internship paved the way to \nexplore different career paths in the future; as I realize there is an infinite number of \nfields to divulge in. As of ERM systems and Odoo Software, I am proud to say I am a bit \nmore experienced with this line of work; and, it will definitely encourage me to partake \non any line of activity where I can utilize the aforementioned skills that I gained while \npartaking in this internship. Most of all, I was glad to work in a safe work environment \nwhere I was encouraged to absorb information as much as possible. The \ncommunicating skills I profited from my duration there was priceless. All in all, I am very \nsatisfied from my working experience. \n'
