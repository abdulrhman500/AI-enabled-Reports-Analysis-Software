The sole reason I am writing this report is to discuss each and every detail of the fruitful internship I have done 
during this summer vacation in Talaat Moustafa Group, while going over various information surrounding the 
company such as its long-standing history and the services it offers. In addition, this report will be covering the 
various tasks I was asked to perform throughout the duration of my internship. I specifically opted for TMG for 
this year’s internship due to its untethered reputation in being one of the biggest and most innovative 
conglomerates in in the middle east which made me curious about getting to know how a business like this 
operatesand integrates its huge system of applications and websites all together to help in meeting all its goals. 
The Talaat Moustafa Group was founded by the late Talaat Moustafa and is headed by his son, Hisham Talaat 
Moustafa in the year 1974.The group is known for the development of integrated communities, including 
mixed-use real estate and hospitality projects across Egypt. Comprising 23 companies, the group is estimated to 
be worth LE 26.7 billion at the current market capitalization and employs more than 12,000 people along with 
60,000 additional workers at its various project sites. TMG is behind some of Egypt's largest community 
developments, including the New Cairo cities of Madinaty, El Rehab, Celia, and the recently launched, Noor. 
Other developments include May Fair in El Sherouq City, El Rabwa in Sheikh Zayed City, Virginia Beach in 
the North Coast of Alexandria, and El Radwa El Khadraa in El Agamy. In all, TMG boasts a population of over 
1 million residents across its projects, ranking it the highest in the world for a private developer. 
I had a worthwhile time at the Talaat Moustafa Group’s Technical Support Department which was the core IT 
department that helped resolve any technical issue. The department supports managing, repairing, and 
maintaining IT systems. They are in charge of troubleshooting network problems, installing and configuring 
hardware and software, and identifying and fixing malfunctions. There, I was given a variety of tasks, including 
troubleshooting technical problems with the help of the Active Directory, installing and configuring hardware 
and software such as Windows 10 and sometimes Linux along with various applications, diagnosing and fixing 
faults and then identifying the necessary hardware, software and network solutions on my own by researching 
the faults I have found, presenting them to my manager and then implementing them. Throughout the day, 
things got quite busy that occasionally I had to handle several cases all at once.  
My internship with the Talaat Moustafa Group has given me a great deal of experience and a peek into the field 
of work, along with the opportunity to learn new skills like how to instantly troubleshoot hardware and software 
problems and how to formulate and come up with workable solutions for every issue. I would say that the 
internship has lived up to my expectations, extended my perspective, and motivated me to seek a future job in 
the TMG IT Departments. Additionally, because the internship revolved around the aspects of information 
technology, it was generally closely tied to my academic work. The internship was specifically relevant to the 
courses CSEN602: Operating Systems, CSEN601: Computer System Architecture and CSEN503: Introduction 
to Communication Networks. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that my internship with the Talaat Moustafa Group was a fantastic experience 
that helped me with learning and understanding what to expect in a professional workspace, as well as helping 
me to gain new skills that would help me with my future studies and as well as helping me to relate my 
academics with the real and professional work life. The Talaat Moustafa Group's overall IT department lived up 
to my expectations in terms of being well-organized and extremely professional, with every employee 
collaborating to find solutions and provide a reliable malware-free system for a company as large and well-
known as TMG to be able to work with.
