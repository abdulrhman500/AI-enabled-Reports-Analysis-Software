Internship Report   
I’m writing this report to summarize my summer internship experience at the German University 
in Cairo titled “Egyptian speech emotion recognition dataset” supervised by Prof/Dr Mohamed 
Salem and Eng. Sarah Khaled. The internship was a 6-week internship and the purpose was to 
increase the data for training the machine learning model and then manipulating and analyzing 
the data. The internship was very interesting since I got interested in machine learning and deep 
learning and I was hoping to join an internship related to those fields to improve my skills. The 
report covers the tasks I performed during the internship, the tools I used, the skills I gained and 
how it was beneficial to me and how it’s related to my studies.  
The German University in Cairo GUC https://www.guc.edu.eg/, is an Egyptian Private 
University founded by the presidential decree 27/2002. The German University in Cairo is an 
independent, non-profit oriented Egyptian private institution, managed by a consortium of 
Germans and Egyptians with the vision of building a leading center of excellence. The vision of 
the GUC is to build a leading center of excellence in teaching and research that will effectively 
contribute to the general welfare nationally and internationally and endeavor the scientific, 
technical, economic and cultural cooperation between Egypt and Germany. The mission of the 
GUC includes achieving excellence in teaching and research, attract students of high 
potentialities, provide the chance for students from neighboring countries to pursue their studies 
and obtain their academic degrees at international standards, award annual scholarships for 
distinguished students, thus promoting talent and excellence among students, and commit itself 
to the training and development of academic and non-academic staff as key resources to the 
success of GUC.  
My task was to gather a dataset for training a machine learning model for the emotional Egyptian 
speech recognition, my task was to record a total of 500 audio files using Audacity software each 
ranging from 1 second to 9 seconds from 3 different Egyptian series. I had to record 6 different 
emotions sad, happy, angry, surprised, fearful, and neutral and the audio files had to be balanced 
for accuracy. There was an excel sheet and I had to fill it by writing the names of the audios, the 
gender of the speaker in the audio, the age group of the speaker, and the emotion of the speaker 
in the audio. After gathering the data and recording it in an excel sheet, I did some data analysis 
using python and pandas library on google colab, I had to calculate the total number of males 
 
and females in the audios, and find the total number of each emotion. I also had to listen to my 
teammates’ audio files (1500 audio files) and vote on the emotion present in that audio. Using 
the votings we had the chance to see if an audio had different opinions on the emotion and we 
had to write a code to change the emotion of the audio according to the emotion having the most 
votes. The second task was a coding task where I had to code in python to remove any silence or 
noise in the audio files using (noisereduce) library in python. The internship was work from 
home and we had meetings at the beginning to align things and know our tasks. I also had the 
chance to work with my teammates and share our thoughts and discussions. I generally used 
audacity to record audio files and google colab and VS code to write python code. I had to 
research about machine learning and how to improve the model’s accuracy for better outcome 
and I came across a lot of machine learning models like regression and clustering. This is a 
sample of the data analysis I did:  
  
The internship was very beneficial as it improved my data analysis and data science skills. Now  
I’m aware that manipulating data and getting the information needed from the data is important. 
Moreover, my coding and debugging skills got improved since I had some errors while coding 
and I needed to figure out where is problem is and solve it. The internship met my expectations 
since it was very interesting. The internship got me more interested and exposed to machine 
 
learning and artificial intelligence and it made me want to pursue similar fields as a career 
opportunity like data engineering and data science. The coding task was related to my studies 
since I used python and ran the code on the data to get insights I also had to debug whenever 
there are errors to fix them. Moreover, the most relevant courses to my internship is introduction 
to computer science (CSEN), Math3 (MATH301), introduction to media Engineering 
(DMET501), signal and system theory (COMM401). I would definitely recommend similar 
internships to my fellow GUC students.  
In conclusion, I’m very grateful to have been accepted in this internship. It was a challenging yet 
an eye-opening experience since I had the chance to know different computer science fields and 
career options like data science. I learnt that problem solving is a crucial skill that I’ve gained 
during my 3 years in the GUC and it helped me a lot during my internship. Furthermore, I learnt 
that the machine learning model’s accuracy gets improved by providing more data for the model 
and I’m very grateful to have been one of the people that contributed to increasing the dataset 
and thus improving the model’s accuracy.
