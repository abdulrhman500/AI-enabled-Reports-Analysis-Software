The internship\'s \npurpose was to acquire more experience in the business world and real-life situations \nhappening at work. Also, my main goal was to enhance my technical skills and understand \nmore about testing and quality control in the software development industry. The objective \nof this report is to describe the company\'s motive and idea, my role there and tasks I have \nperformed, what I have gained from the experience, my overall internship evaluation, and \nthen give a brief conclusion of the report. \nInstabug, a software company founded in 2014, is a Software Development Kit (SDK) \nthat empowers mobile companies to iterate faster and enhance their application quality by \nproviding intuitive user feedback channels and comprehensive application insights. It \nprovides a seamless way for two-way communication with users while providing detailed \nenvironment reports for developers. The SDK allows developers to smoothly detect and \nsolve their application\'s bugs and crashes faster and more ef\xef\xac\x81ciently. Instabug offers \nmultiple products to help enhance the user experience, where each product sends and \nreceives real-time, in-context data to and from the app. These products include Bug \nReporting & Feedback, Crash Reporting, In- App-Surveys & Announcements, Feature \nRequests, App Insights and App Performance Monitoring.\nDuring the internship, I started by attending educational sessions given by our team \nleaders to learn how the SDK works and to understand each product and its purpose. We \nalso learned the concepts of testing, how to differentiate being a good tester, the basics of \nmanual testing and a brief introduction to automation testing. After each session, a task \nwas assigned to practice the taught information. These tasks included writing test cases \nand scenarios for each product, manually executing the test cases on the products and \nthen applying the review comments given by the team leader. During the second part of \nthe internship, they involved us in the production of the SDK\'s new features and each \nintern was added to a squad for a speci\xef\xac\x81c product. I was in the "Crash Reporting" squad. \nWe participated from the beginning of the new cycle, which lasted six weeks. It starts with \na planning week, where we plan each story discussing every single detail with all the other \nteams (Backend, Frontend, IOS and Android), and then we add subtasks with time \nestimations to the story and assign each task to a team member. Following the planning \nweek, I started performing the tasks assigned to me, which included writing the test cases \nfor the story, manually executing these test cases and being brie\xef\xac\x82y involved in the \nautomation tasks. \nConcerning my internship evaluation, I think it was a great addition to my technical skills \nas it has enhanced my knowledge of software testing and how to ensure good quality for it. \nI executed various types of testing, including web testing and SDK testing. My tasks \nfocused mainly on manual testing of the products, and during this, I have learned about \nautomation testing for both Back-end and Front-end. I got also introduced to Kubernetes, \n\x0cwhich I used while testing to manage the application and apply changes easily. The SDK \nused an SQL database to store the data, which improved my skills in this \xef\xac\x81eld. The \ncompany used Agile methodology to release new features to their products, and this was \nmy \xef\xac\x81rst time seeing how it gets executed in real-life software development. It helped me \nunderstand more about it like, how is the sprint conducted, the meetings in the sprint, the \nrole of each team member and the tasks done in each sprint. As for soft skills, I have \ngained a lot of communication skills and learned to work and interact with people in \ndifferent teams and manage to do several tasks together under strict deadlines. This \ninternship met my expectations and in\xef\xac\x82uenced my future career plans in many ways. It \nmotivated me to develop myself to move from an academic lifestyle to a working \nenvironment lifestyle. Also, it encouraged me to keep enhancing my technical skills and \nworking on my gaps in this \xef\xac\x81eld. The internship activities were related to my studies, as my \nassigned tasks were in the \xef\xac\x81eld of my studies. They are related to some of the courses I \nhave taken including Software Engineering -CSEN 603- where we learned about git and \nGitHub, the basics concepts and types of testing and the methodologies of software \ndevelopment like the agile methodology. Also, it was related to Data Base I -CSEN501- \nwhere we learned about SQL, which was used in the internship activities.\nOverall, I think it was a great experience to have had training in such a well-known \ncompany that ensures a great working environment for its employees and motivates them \nto do their best and enhance their capabilities. Besides, I \xef\xac\x81nd that the internship program \nwas well organized, and their target is to bring the best out of their employees and \nencourage them to do more, and I think they succeeded in achieving that. I\xe2\x80\x99ve learnt that \nthere\xe2\x80\x99s so much more than just having technical skills, such as having the ability to \ncommunicate, interact with people, know how to react in different situations and how to \nabide by timelines and strict deadlines. \n\x0c'
