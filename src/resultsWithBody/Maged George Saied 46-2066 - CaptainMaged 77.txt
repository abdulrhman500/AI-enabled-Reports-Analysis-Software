b"\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0cThis internship was at Sarana jewelry in Cairo, Egypt. The internship had two main \npurposes. One purpose was to research and study how to implement an application with \nXamarin forms or Flutter and how to import a 3D into an application. Another purpose was \nimplementing the main project of the internship. The project's task was implementing a cross \nplatform mobile application for Sarana jewelry. The application was aimed to sell Sarana\xe2\x80\x99s \njewelry. The main premium feature for the application that differs it from any other digital \nmarketing application is that the application displays the pieces of jewelry as a 3D model not \njust a simple 2D image. \nSarana jewelry is one of the top jewelries selling company and it was established in the early \n2000s. Moreover, Sarana jewelry has a powerful presence at worldwide exhibitions, dealing \nwith clients from all over the world. Furthermore, Sarana jewelry is a member of the world \nknown HRD club. In addition, Many of Sarana\xe2\x80\x99s family have been in the business for more \nthan 35 years and there are many certified diamond graders by the globally recognized \nassociations including HRD & GIA. Product examples include rings, twins, bracelets, \npendants, and earrings. \nThe project had a total of three interns, including me and there was a supervisor from the IT \ndepartment of the company. The application was implemented using Flutter open-source UI \nsoftware development kit and the dart Object oriented programming language. The three \ninterns researched how to use Flutter and Dart to implement an application and how to \nimport 3D models into that application. In addition, Xamarin, c#, and XML were originally \nlearned and researched, however Xamarin had no successful libraries that imports 3D models \nsuccessfully and as a result, Flutter was used. The resulted application has three main pages: \nthe home page, the page for the product selected, and the 3D model page. The home page is \nwhere the user can find all the products and selects one of the products. Next, the product \npage displays a 2D image of the product, the color of the product (rose gold, gold, or silver) \nand many other product features. The product page also has a button called 3D, which \ntransfer the user to the 3D page. The 3D page displays the product in 3D, allowing the user to \nnavigate around the model freely (rotating and zooming). \nThere are many rewarding skills that I have learned in this internship. Technical skills \ninclude: learning how to implement a cross platform mobile application using Flutter and \nDart, learning how to display a 3D model using the Babylon library, and learning how to \nimplement a cross platform mobile application using Xamarin Forms. Soft skills include: \nlearning to work in a team, reporting to my supervisor in a sorted manner, and learning on \nour own (research skills). This internship met my expectations as I now know how to create \ncross platform mobile applications. Moreover, this will influence my future career greatly, as \nthis was something I would like to work with. The Dart programming language and Java \nprogramming language are similar. As a result, the most related course I took in the GUC to \nthe internship is CSEN202 Introduction to Computer Programming. \n\x0cTo sum up everything that has been stated so far, I have received an enormous amount of \nknowledge and experience from this internship at Sarana jewelry. A rewarding experience \nwas learning more about mobile applications and boosting my researching skills. \nFurthermore, I managed to improve my teamwork skills, as the project was performed by \ntwo interns, and myself, working together. In addition, working from office was really \nhelpful, showing me what is daily work experience as an Engineer. These inspired me a lot \nand opened new paths to think of in my future career. \n"
