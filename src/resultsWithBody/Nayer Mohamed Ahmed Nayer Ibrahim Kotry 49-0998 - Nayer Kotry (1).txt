b"\x0c\x0c\x0cInternship Title: AI and Big Data intern \nCompany / Organization Name: Vodafone \n \nIn the summer of 2022, I took my first internship at Vodafone Egypt with the intent of gaining \nexperience, learning about data science, getting a taste of working at a multinational company \nand networking with people in my field of work. This report will be specifying the skills I have \nacquired, the tasks I was given and summarize my whole internship experience in the next 4 \nparagraphs. In the first paragraph I will be describing the company that I worked for, the second \nparagraph will be listing the tasks that I have performed, following this paragraph I will be \nexplaining what I have gained from this internship and last but not least, end this report with a \nconclusion about my whole internship experience. \n \nVodafone is a leading technology communications company in Europe and Africa founded in \nJuly 17, 1984, Newbury, United Kingdom and launched in Egypt in 1998 under its former name \n\xe2\x80\x9cClick GSM\xe2\x80\x9d. Their main aim is building a sustainable digital society that is inclusive for all, \nwhere technology and connectivity are enhancing the future and improving people's lives. \nVodafone offers a range of market leading mobile and fixed-line connectivity services for both \nconsumers and businesses. Furthermore, they partner with technology firms and other \norganization to provide customers with outstanding digital experiences. Vodafone also provides \nan E-wallet service that allows consumers to deposit and withdraw cash through ATMs \n \nDuring my time at Vodafone Egypt, I was given a few tasks in order to get to experience the \nwork life of a data scientist. In the beginning, we were given a data science with python course \nto study and a few topics to look up including unsupervised machine learning and clustering \nmodels. To make sure that we understood these topics, we were given a dataset and were asked \nto clean, explore, preprocess and use different clustering algorithms to segment the customers \nand give insights about each cluster. We were then given our main task which was \n\xe2\x80\x9crecommendation and geomarketing\xe2\x80\x9d, where we were given a dataset that we applied different \nclustering algorithms on in order to find the socioeconomic class per location and give insights \nabout the customers that are in each class. Finally, we were asked to prepare a presentation about \nour work and present it to the data science team. \n\x0c \nDue to this internship, I have gained teamwork skills since our main task was a group task and \nwork was distributed evenly on us. I also believe that I have gained some networking skill not \nonly, did I get to network with the employees, but also with fellow interns thanks to the intern \nactivities that Vodafone offered. I have also acquired self-learning skills since I am new to the \nfield and did not know much about it. The internship definitely met my expectations and gave \nme a chance to discover a possible future career path and get to know other career paths as well \nbecause of the sessions given out by Vodafone team leaders where they talked about their field \nof work. The correlation between my studies and my internship activities is that I was using my \nlearnings from python and other programming courses in order to write my code on google collab \nand also math courses in order to understand the clustering algorithms and the data. A few \ncourses that I believe were related to the internship include: CSEN 102, CSEN 202, Math 401. \n \nTo conclude, the internship was all around a great experience it gave me a different look on \ncorporate life. Furthermore, it helped me acquire new knowledge in data science and machine \nlearning and opened my eyes to a possible career path that I might pursue in the future. The \nenvironment that Vodafone created for its interns allowed us to network with each other and \nexpand our knowledge in different fields of work by the sessions given and the events they \ncreated. Working in the big data team made me realize how important it is for big companies \nand how it allows the company to understand their consumers and be able to target them with \nthe products that would most likely be relevant to them.  \n \nReferences: (If any external sources are used, provide references for any information quoted) \n \n \nPlease rate your satisfaction with the internship experience. \n\xe2\x98\x90 Very satisfied      \n \nWould you recommend this internship to other colleagues?  \n\xe2\x98\x90 Yes                          \n \nAppendices: \n\x0c \n \n \nDisclosure / Confidentiality Agreement \n \nThis agreement is to acknowledge that the information provided by any company / organization \nduring the internship is unique to this business and confidential. \nTherefore, anyone reading this agreement agrees not to disclose any of the information provided \nduring the internship without notifying & taking the employer\xe2\x80\x99s / supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s approval. \n"
 response result:
 The performed tasks during the internship are as follows:
1. Studied a data science with python course and researched topics such as unsupervised machine learning and clustering models.
2. Cleaned, explored, and preprocessed a dataset, and applied different clustering algorithms to segment customers and provide insights about each cluster.
3. Conducted "recommendation and geomarketing" task by applying different clustering algorithms on a dataset to determine socioeconomic class per location and provide insights about customers in each class.
4. Prepared a presentation about the work and presented it to the data science team.
