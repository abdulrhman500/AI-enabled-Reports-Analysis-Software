b'\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0cDuring my internship at Nokia, my main objective was to gain as much knowledge/ experience \nas possible in the telecom sector to help facilitate my studies in various fields that are inevitably \nrelated to the communication domain. This internship provided me an opportunity of exposure to \na wide range of topics from professionals at Nokia, a tech-giant in the telecommunications field. \nThis report includes a brief introduction to Nokia, an in-depth report on the topics I was able to \ndiscuss and learn at Nokia as well as the intern-level projects I took part in, during my time there. \nThis report also includes an overview of my apprenticeship, the skills I managed to cultivate and \nhow these skills are related to and shall work concurrently with what I learnt in college.  \nNokia Corporation, established in 1865, is a Finnish multinational telecommunication, \ninformation technology and consumer electronics corporation. As a trusted partner for critical \nnetworks, Nokia is committed to innovation and technology leadership across mobile, fixed and \ncloud networks. They create value with intellectual property and long term-research, led by the \naward-winning Nokia Bell Labs. With over a 100 thousand employees worldwide and 38 offices \nacross the MENA region only, Nokia\xe2\x80\x99s focus is distributed across four business groups \nstructured around customer offerings. Each business group aims to become a technology and \nmarket leader in their respective sector, such mentioned business groups are as follows. Firstly, \nMobile networks sector that is focused on regaining technology leadership in 5G while growing \nits private wireless business with enterprise customers. Secondly, Network infrastructure, \nfocused on the building blocks and essential solutions of critical networks across all customer \nsegments. Cloud and networks services is the third focus which is aimed towards creating value \nfor both service providers and enterprise customers to meet the demands of the ever-accelerating \ncritical networks. Finally, Nokia technologies are focused on monetizing and growing the value \nof Nokia\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual property and licensing revenue by investing in innovation.  \nThe main structure of the internship was a 4 hours daily live-session that included 2 Nokia \nEngineers giving brief lectures about their specialties, specific projects that they are working on \nat Nokia and how such theoretical principals we as interns learn in college correlate to real life \npractical hypothesis. They also ensured providing enough space for interns to ask questions as to \ngather as much experience as possible. On our first day we were greeted by Nokia\xe2\x80\x99s Chief of \nStaff, Radwa Hafez which gave a brief overview of Nokia\xe2\x80\x99s History, mission, and current \nbusiness strategy. From that point on, we were given lectures on topics that included an in-depth \n\x0cintroduction to 2G technology, the evolution journey from 2G to 3G as well as real life analysis \nof 4G in Egypt and conceptual development and deployment of 5G across the globe. The topics \nwere not only inclusive to telecommunication domain but also Internet Protocols in the context \nof DSL in Access Networks, Internet of Things, Cloud & Networks Services as well as many \nMachine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence focused sessions and their \nassociation to telecommunications and Internet Protocol domain. The Human Resources team \nalso made sure to share their experience with us by giving many soft skills sessions that included \nResume writing and what HR representatives are search for in a CV, how long it takes for an HR \nrepresentative to go over a resume and how we as fresh graduates can facilitate our resumes to \npartially guarantee a job offer on our end. They also shared different tips in communicating with \ndifferent types of personalities in workspace as well as time management and productivity skills. \nDuring my internship I was assigned to two main tasks, one of which was to pitch a creative \nidea, in which we apply the knowledge, experience and skills we have obtained through the \ncourse of the internship, to our supervisors that can adopt these ideas through Nokia\xe2\x80\x99s \ndevelopment labs, consequently bringing value in the future and enriching people\xe2\x80\x99s lives. My \ntask consisted of a detailed plan of a smart biometric system that enhanced cardiovascular \nexercise in a revolutionary manner that would evidently help reduce obesity and heart disease \nrates world-wide. The task also included a business plan and a revised total cost necessary for \ndeveloping the project, as well as a detailed microarchitecture for the device software and \nhardware. This task took 1 week of development and was received by my direct supervisor with \na gratifying impression. The main focus was rather directed at the bigger task, presented at the \nend of the internship in which I, along with fellow interns, prepared a presentation in which we \napply the concepts we learnt during the course of the internship to a certain topic of choice which \nwas Nokia\xe2\x80\x99s Cloud services. This presentation included a complete portfolio of Nokia\xe2\x80\x99s Cloud \nsolutions that shall help IP-intensive corporations extend network connectivity, work with public \ncloud providers, and implement data centers that are up to a certain standard guaranteed by \nNokia. Such cloud systems must also operate under reduced costs and up-to-date technologies \nwhile maintaining the newest security standards.  \nThrough my internship at Nokia, I was able to gain experience in various fields including, firstly, \n5G and Telecommunications by interacting with Engineers in and outside Egypt that were \nresponsible for developing and maintaining 4G networks across many regions. Secondly, \n\x0cInternet Protocol which would help me in deciding my career path after college by being \nexposed to various technologies such as Big Data, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and \ndeep learning, and finally, cloud computing. Finally, during my time at Nokia I was able to make \nmany contacts in my field that would help me in deciding my career path efficiently after \ngraduating.  By being able to relate concepts that I had learnt in courses such as Networks in \nsemester 5 and Networks & Media Labs in semester 6, I was able to obtain a solid understanding \nof concepts such as TCP/IP & OSI models by being exposed to relevant real-life application, as \nwell as topology architectures and Switching concepts learnt in Networks & Media Lab. Having \nlearnt concepts such as OSPF and static routing before attending to my internship also made my \nadaptation process much easier at the beginning. The telecommunication sector is highly \nsensitive to the slightest change in regulatory, technological, and economic factors. With \nwireless and broadbands in plans, the industry shareholders present unique techniques to \novercome challenges and move towards connecting people and organizations. To conclude, I \nhereby state that I was more than satisfied with the overall experience of interning at Nokia and I \nwould love to obtain another opportunity to work with them again during my career. \n'
