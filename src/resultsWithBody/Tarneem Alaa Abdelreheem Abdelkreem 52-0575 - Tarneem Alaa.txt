I worked with the android applications developers team, gaining much \nknowledge from them, watching how they develop applications, how they design it visually \nmaking it approachable and easy to be used along with coding using the widely used Android \napplications programming language Kotlin and how they meet the customer\xe2\x80\x99s expectations and \nneeds using their developed mobile applications. Moreover, the internship was a step to learn \nmore about how the work field grows, learning the communication and teamwork between the \nemployees to deliver the best service that meets satisfaction, and learning about punctuality \nwhile dealing with work stress. \n \nWE Data - previously called \xe2\x80\x9cTE Data\xe2\x80\x9d- was established in 2001 by Telecom Egypt for \ncommunication and Internet purposes. WE Data is Egypt\'s largest IP-based data communications \ncarrier with a national network and a regional vision. In addition, WE Data was awarded a Class \nA license from Egypt\'s National Telecommunication Regulatory Authority (NTRA). It is the \nmain company that provides to other ones and has the greatest shares among them. WE Data \ndesign, test, deploy and manage IP network-computing solutions which are tailored to fit each \ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s unique needs aiming towards better technology which is what the whole world \ndepends on right now, and also creates websites, mobile applications, and middleware in order to \nprovide consumers with the best up-to-date services. Recently, WE Data is rolling out in Jordan \nand more regional operations planned which proves their professionalism and success. \n \nI have performed various tasks during my internship at WE Data as an Android \nApplication developer intern. Firstly, I got introduced to application development generally and \nhow they meet user needs, whether it is an android application or an IOS one. Then, I got \nintroduced to the various ways android applications are developed whether by using Java or the \nnewly widespread Kotlin which is more commonly used in the industry nowadays. Moreover, I \nlearned about Android Studio providing app builders, and code editors with an integrated \ndevelopment environment (IDE) optimized for Android apps with a flexible build system, real-\ntime profilers, and emulators and actually seeing how the application will look like while \ncreating the application in real-time. For the view, you can add the components that appear on an \napplication using drag and drop manually, or writing the code yourself in activity_main.xml file \n\x0cfound in the layout. While creating your view and the layout you can choose between different \nlayouts such as Constraint Layout, Linear Layout, Frame Layout, and Table Layout according to \nwhat matches the design, with the ability to add many components as text areas, different buttons \nas checkboxes or radiobutton or switch and many more. We have more components such as \nwidgets as seekBar, rating bar, and progress bar, and even additional things like AdView and \nMapView.I was able to modify the view to represent it the way preferred by making it manually \nand writing the correct code for it. Also , I did some assigned research reading more about \nAndroid Studio features. One of the tasks that I performed was preforming this design from \nscratch : \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0cMoreover, I worked along with other interns to learn more from our mentors on the professional \nand technical problems and we learned how to tackle the problems and assigned tasks. \n     I am satisfied with this internship as I learned new skills that I have never been introduced to \nbefore, as this is my first engagement with mobile applications so I learned a good overview of \nhow they work, how they are built, and how they are published till they are on the user\xe2\x80\x99s phones. \nKnowing more about application development, especially android apps development made me \nhave an interest in learning more about it, deepening my knowledge and even thinking of it as \none of the available choices as a career path or using it as a step in my career path in order to \ngrow with better skills and knowledge, knowing that apps development is a rewarding career \nwith the high demand on mobile applications as everyone carries a smartphone right now. Aside \nfrom the technical side, I also gained a lot of skills on the professional side, how things are \nhandled inside the office, punctuality , dealing with colleagues and being able to work in a team \nalong with other interns to get the assigned tasks done and handle things in a manageable way. \nThe internship was related to my studies as it all opens different paths that I could go for after \npursuing my CS career. In a way, CS4 course was kind of related as we used Java to make the \nmarvel game. I would recommend the internship to my colleagues in the GUC. \n\x0c      In conclusion, the internship in WE Data was useful and made me gain many skills. I got \nintroduced to a completely new career field for me which is Android app development which \nmade me learn more coding, seeing new things as designs made using the components and \nmanaging them by code to make them fit and sufficient to the user needs. In addition, I learned \nmore about meeting the user\xe2\x80\x99s needs and expectations using apps. A lot of soft skills were \nlearned such as communication, being able to work as a part of a team, and problem-solving \nwhich is very beneficial. WE Data has a great mobile applications developing sector with a great \nteam that is able to tackle any problems, and bring out a sufficient service with great apps, \nshowing how much knowledge and amazing skills made this turn out all successfully.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n'
