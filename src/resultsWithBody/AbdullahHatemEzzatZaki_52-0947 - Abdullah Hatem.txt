This is my internship report in which I will discuss and write about my internship period during 
the last summer which was in Aman E-Payments. Aman is a FINTECH company and I Aman as 
a software developer in my internship. I am going to discuss the company description and 
industry with its main goals and objectives, then I’ll move on to describe the tasks and activities I 
did during my internship period. After discussing this, I’ll talk about the skills, experience and 
knowledge I gained and how was the internship related to my major. Finally, I will conclude the 
report with a short summary of the general observations I made and experience I gained 
throughout my internship period. 
 
Firstly, Aman for e-payments is a subsidiary of Raya Holding, it is a young Egyptian FINTECH 
company that has the potential to become the leading FINTECH company in the region. 
Additionally, Aman envisions an ultimate Egyptian cashless society with financial inclusion for 
previously unattainable to a lot of Egyptians. Aman offers a wide variety of financial services for 
a better quality of life according to people’s and the society needs. Here are some examples 
about the services of Aman, you can pay utilities, Bill payments, installments, donations and 
much more with Aman in minutes. These services can be used from individuals and small stores 
to large enterprise. The main goal of Aman is to become the most preferred FINTECH company 
in our region. 
 
During my internship period, I have done projects and tasks related to software development. My 
supervisor assigned me projects and tasks. We had meetings every now and then to follow up my 
progress and to give me any additional requirements, sometimes we had meetings with product 
managers, UI designers and other developers. On these days, I present the project progress to 
them and discuss any issues then get to work on any further requirements. If I don’t have a 
meeting, I work on the project with the team and if I needed help I either do my own research or 
ask my supervisor. My first project was to build an end-to-end web application which should be 
built for merchants who use Aman POS in order to track their transaction and sales data 
alongside with some data aggregation and reports throughout the year. The project included 
building a full login and registration system which have the following functionalities: register, 
login, reset password via email and logout. Once the merchant log in, he should view all his 
previous transaction data, statistics and charts in order to assess his sales and performance. 
Another project was to build a web application to automate bill payments for small medium 
enterprises. In this project, we worked in a team of 3. The web application acted as a middleman 
between the enterprises and Aman system that is already implemented to make bank transfers 
and payments. The project included but not limited to full user registration system, allowing the 
user to upload excel files that contains the upcoming bills with their full info then the web app 
sends it to Aman system to take care of the rest. The user was also allowed to see his bills report 
and updates. For these projects to be implemented I used MERN stack which is MongoDB, 
Expressjs, Reactjs and Nodejs. MongoDB. MongoDB was used to be our database to store user, 
transactions and bills data. Express, node and mongoose together was used to build the backend 
and the API of the web application which included but not limited to authorization (JWT), 
authentication, password encryption, data schemas, CRUD operations, data sanitization, security, 
rate limiting, uploading files, CORS policy, error handling, automated emails with Mailtrap and 
SendGrid, cookies and data modeling. React was used to build the frontend of the web 
application and communicate with our backend in order to develop the full stack app. I have 
done a lot of research and watched a lot of videos regarding these technologies in order to be 
able to implement these projects securely and in a professional way.  
 
During my internship, I have gained soft and technical skills. I have developed the following soft 
skills: Teamwork, communication skills, leadership skills, problem solving and time 
management. We have worked on projects in teams, so we had to communicate with each 
other’s, solve challenges that rise and taking time and deadlines into consideration. Regarding 
the technical skills I have developed my software development and testing skills. I have learnt 
new technologies like MERN stack, testing software like postman, RESTFUL APIs design, 
backend and frontend development. Due to developing and gaining all these skills and 
knowledge the internship met my expectations because I learned and developed a lot of 
knowledge and skills. This internship will help me in my future career plans because it let me to 
discover and dig deeper into software engineering which I loved so I’ll take this into 
consideration when I take new courses or apply for new internships or jobs. Also, software 
engineering is a subfield in my major which is computer science and engineering as it includes 
coding, developing, testing, algorithms and lots of topics that is taught in my major. The most 
course that is related to my internship was computer programming lab (CSEN 401), which was 
to develop a full end to end game and using MVC architecture to develop it. In my humble 
opinion, I encourage other GUC students to apply to Aman because they will surely develop 
great soft and technical skills and will simply have some great time there. 
 
To conclude, I have benefited from this internship in many different ways. I have gained so 
much experience on how to perform a task, communicate with your supervisor and communicate 
with other departments and colleagues to get the job done. Problem solving is a very important 
skill that I developed, and lastly getting an observation of the industry and getting outside the 
confined academic experience only. I observed a lot of things like how people handle problems 
and conflicts, how colleagues communicate with each other’s in work and outside the office, 
how to follow up and participate in meetings and much more. 
 
 

response result:
The performed tasks during the internship period at Aman E-Payments include:

1. Building an end-to-end web application for merchants using Aman POS. This included creating a login and registration system, displaying transaction data and statistics for merchants, and generating reports.

2. Developing a web application to automate bill payments for small medium enterprises. This involved building a user registration system, allowing users to upload excel files with bill information, and integrating with the Aman system for bank transfers and payments.

3. Utilizing MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) for both projects, including database management, backend development, and frontend design.

4. Conducting research and learning about various technologies and techniques, such as RESTful API design, testing software like Postman, and software development best practices.

In addition to the specific tasks, the intern also gained soft skills such as teamwork, communication, leadership, problem-solving, and time management. They also developed technical skills in software development and testing, as well as gaining knowledge in their field of study (computer science and engineering). The internship allowed them to apply what they learned in their major and will benefit their future career plans. Overall, the internship provided valuable experience, observation of industry practices, and the opportunity to develop a wide range of skills.
