AUB was first started in 2000 as a merge between the United Bank of \nKuwait and the Ahli Commercial Bank, and was licensed to operate by the Central Bank of \nBahrain. The AUB group\xe2\x80\x99s mission statement is \xe2\x80\x9cTo create an unrivaled ability to meet \ncustomer\xe2\x80\x99s needs, provide fulfillment and development for our staff and deliver outstanding \nshareholder value\xe2\x80\x9d (referenced below is the official AUB link containing the mission, vision, \nstrategic objectives, and leader(s) reports). The vision of AUB is to be the leading private, \nretail, and commercial banking institution in the Gulf area, with its objectives mainly \nconcerning what\xe2\x80\x99s best for the shareholder value as well as for the counties it operates in as \nwell as its workers. The official email of AUB for information services is \ninfo@ahliunited.com. The Bank works in the Banking and finance sector such as corporate \nand trade finance, correspondent banking, retail banking, etc. For The IT department, the \ndepartment I interned in, The the chart goes as Mr. Amir being the Head Senior Developer, \nthen Mr. Farouk was my supervisor and another senior developer, then other developers in \ndifferent development areas (Stack, software engineering, requirements engineering, etc.), \nand then me and my colleague at the internship. \n \n \n For our internship activities, I spent an intensive 4 weeks where the main goal at the \nend was to develop a functional web application using SSMS, .NET Core Entity Framework, \nand Angular. The team consisted of just me and my friend Kurolos in the developers team, \nand for the whole four weeks we had to both learn how to use these languages then be able to \nmake and application using them. Our application was a Caf\xc3\xa9/Cyber reservation system, \nwhere a user can reserve rooms or devices online and the cyber manager could then either \naccept or reject. The system is also to provide the admins/managers a way to show what spots \nare currently busy or not so that users wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t reserve an already taken spot. System admins \ncould also add new caf\xc3\xa9/cyber locations as well as their many details. A typical working day \nfor me would be to come to the creative room, start logging my work and planning my \nactivities for the day (I worked in sprints to get certain tasks done as a way to manage my \nwork ethic) and then got to work. I would work everyday of the week from 8 AM till 4 PM \n\x0c \n \nMahmoud Abdelaziz Wagdy Abdelaziz \n \n49-3686 \n                                                                                                                                               MET CSEN  \n \n \nand sometimes even later, all in a suit and tie as per company rules. The tools I used are the \nlanguages mentioned above and in terms of the research I\xe2\x80\x99ve made it was mostly core \ncomputing and development logic ideals such as dependency injection between repositories \nand controllers, N-tier development pattern for development (for which we used 3Tier as in \nAPI-Business-Presentation), the SOLID design principles, as well as learning how to use \nthese new languages. It was a lot to go through in a short period but as exercises to test our \nlearning we were given weekly tasks to perform which mainly consisted of smaller programs \nand web pages to see if we are at the right level. The most challenging part by far was the \nAngular part especially the HTML CSS design as well as the routing performed between the \nvarious modules. As for work samples I can provide a drive link for one of the API versions \nof the project we worked on as well as pictures of a beta front end, and for charts I only have \na picture of one with me right now as the rest are back home in Egypt while I am currently in \nBerlin. \n \n \nI have gained many skills thanks to this internship opportunity. For starters, I was \nnever really confident in my development skills and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never really actually given it a shot \nto try and build a full scale web application like the one we built, but during the internship \nnot only did we build a web application but I also got the chance to lead my team which is a \nrole that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t assume but just happened to happen. My expectations for the internship \nwere that I was going to use my skills that I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned in University and work with them so I \nthought it would be easy, but in fact it was the opposite as this internship was highly intense \nand condensed, with us having to plow through a lot of new knowledge and use it to build a \nreal life app, so in short not only did it meet my expectations it surpassed them. This \ninternship opened my eyes to the world of web development which prior to it had been \nclosed, and going forward I am more confident in tackling unknown information, learn it, and \nthen use this new found knowledge to my advantage. Of course the internship was highly \nrelated to my major, in fact this semester (7th) in ACML we are doing web development in a \nvery similar methodology to the one at my internship. Core topics as well such as object \noriented features, database management, and software development topics were very related \nto my internship. This internship relates a lot to ACML, CS4, Software Engineering, \nDatabase 1 and 2, and the Introduction to Communication networks project.

Even though it was a very tiring experience \nsince at times even out of work I had to work on the project to meet our deadlines, I still hold \nthis experience very highly and it definitely helped shape my way of thinking moving \nforward. In regards to the company itself, I was not highly related to corporate details or any \nbanking related activities but from what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the actual developers do and from hearing \ntheir discussions and stories, I could safely say that in regards to the development sector, \nAUB is doing a really good job in putting technology forward in the world of finance and \nbanking. \n \nReferences:  \nMain AUB Page: https://www.ahliunited.com/eg/about/ \nAUB Mission, Vision, Strategic Objectives, and Reports: \nhttps://www.ahliunited.com/ar2020/ \nAPI/Backend Version: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IWDjwfxfzuZGN3RcdNL1JW1c-\nltm1BDS/view?usp=sharing \n \n \n\x0c\x0c\x0c \n \n\x0c'
