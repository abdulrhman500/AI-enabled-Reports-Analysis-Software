b'\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0cThis report is prepared in order to better explain and showcase the purpose and the benefits of \nthe Emotion Recognition From Egyptian Speech internship I recently did in the GUC. I went \nthrough this internship with the hopes of getting an insight into the fascinating world of artificial \nintelligence and machine learning utilising some of my technocal ability and understanding the \ncore concepts that contribute to such intensive algorithms. This report will briefly describe the \norganization under which I participated in the internship, provide and explain an insight into the \nactivities I did in the internship and evaluate my experience as well as a short conclusion \nsummarising everything. \nI participated in this internship opportunity under the management and supervision of the GUC \nand more particularly the MET department within the faculty of engineering with direct \nsupervision from Prof. Mohammed Abdel-Megeed Salem and Eng. Sarah Khaled. The German \nUniversity in Cairo or as it is commonly known the GUC is one of the biggest and most \ninfamous universities in Egypt and the MENA region with connections and partnerships with \nmultiple universities abroad as well as another campus operating in Berlin, Germany that hosts \nhundreds of exchange students every semester across all different faculties and departments for \nboth undergraduate and postgradate studies alike. \nWithin this internship I contributed in different ways to the construction of the dataset for an \nalgorithm to recognise different emotions from speech clips in Egyptian Arabic. Although the \nidea in theory is not new there\xe2\x80\x99s a severe lack of documentation and research or libraries/dataset \nfor Egyptian Arabic. Only 1 is publicly available and it has a very limited amount of samples and \nemotions which is not enough to construct a well-functioning, reliable algorithm hence the need \nfor the dataset we worked to construct. A big part of my internship was to record audio clips \nfrom Egyptian Arabic media such as TV shows and movies depicting certain emotions (in our \ncase we covered the 6 emotions: Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised and Fearful). I did so \nusing audacity recording the audio from my PC and then trimming it to avoid any pauses, \nexcessive background noises, any conflicting emotions or essentially anything that would make \nthe recording\xe2\x80\x99s intended emotion hard to distinguish or amigious.I then would label these \nrecordings with the agreed upon naming conventions we were all following showing the \nactor/actress\xe2\x80\x99s name, the emotion intended and a number to keep track of all the clips. These \nclips were uploaded to a google drive accessible to all of us in designated folders to make them \n\x0cmore easily accessible and recorded in a google sheet showing all the relevant details about the \nclip so we could keep track of all the clips we have. After I upload my clips and record them I\xe2\x80\x99d \nthen go through all my colleagues\xe2\x80\x99 clips and give them my own label to reduce errors with each \nof us giving their opinion about eachother\xe2\x80\x99s clips and hence we could then decide if there is any \ndisagreement on which emotion is shown which emotion to use on the label by seeing which \nemotion was voted for my most. Among our tasks was also coding a program to access the \ngoogle sheet and read the data in it to go through the entire sheet and for each entry look at each \nof the members\xe2\x80\x99 entries for the emotion they think is depicted and compare them then decide \nwhich one has the majority and replace it as the main label in the sheet. And also another \nprogram to collect some stats about our dataset which would read the google sheet and go \nthrough it recording some statistics such as how many of the clips are males as compared to \nfemales and how many clips there are of each emotion and then record these statistics in a text \nfile it creates. For these two tasks I used Visual studio code as my IDE and Python as the \nprogramming language and learned how to use libraries such as csv and pandas in python which \nI had no experience with prior to this internship. There were also two other tasks which were to \ncode two programs one to remove silence from the .wav audio clips and another to reduce \nbackground noise as doing such in audacity manually for every clip was a very time consuming \nand inefficient task. I used spyder and Visual studio code to code the two programs and they \nwere also done using Python as a language and I used libraries such as scipy.io , wavfile , \nnoisereduce, math, logging, numpy, librosa and soundfile most of which I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been exposed \nto before and so I had to research how to use and utilise them best to accomplish the task at hand \nand then save the output .wav file as a new file with an updated name. \nOverall I\xe2\x80\x99d say I learned a lot of valuale skills from the internship such as improving my \nteamwork and coordinating with my coworkers to conribute towards a bigger project as well as \nthe technical skills I mentioned since the field of computer science and engineering is an ever-\nevolving field constantly improving and changing so being exposed to as many different \nlibraries,modules,programs etc. is something I believe I will always need to be doing and will \ndefinetly prove helpful in my career. The internship met my expectations as I came into it \nlooking to get an insight into what was previously undiscovered territory for me which is the \nfield of machine learning which is precisely what I got out of it getting a basic introduction into a \nfascinating world I have always wanted to learn more about. This internship will affect my career \n\x0cpath as it has given me a slight idea into machine learning but also made me more eager to know \na lot more about it so I believe it will be a field I will be looking to explore further and more \nintensively in the future. The activites I performed during the internship were directly linked \nwith my studies as they introduced me to a new type of algorithms which is data hungry \nalgorithms as explained by prof. Mohamed who explained them showing how they are different \nfrom all the algorithms I have studied so far which were always right or always wrong as they \nhave a percentage of accuracy that isn\xe2\x80\x99t 100% but improves as you provide it with more data. \nThe internship was related to a lot of the courses I have studied which taught me more and more \nabout coding and algorithms and I had to use all my information regarding that to code the \nprograms we needed and also I was somewhat familiar with audacity due to the DMET courses I \nhad taken previously.This is an internship I would definetly recommend to other students \nbecause of what I explained with it being an excellent entry point to machine learning for anyone \ninterested in the field. \n To sum up, this internship opportunity has taught me a lot and given me an inside look I very \nmuch desired into the world of machine learning which prior to this I had very limited \ninformation about and I am very grateful to have been given the chance to learn about something \nnew and interesting while also practicing such integral skills I would most definetly need in the \nfuture in my career regardless of what particular path I choose to follow such as teamwork, \ncoordination as well as the ability to research and look for answers to fill the blanks in my \ninformation when needed and ofcourse the technical skills from the programs and libraries I got \nto deal with and use to achieve the tasks I was assigned. \n'
