A software engineer is a \nperson who applies the principles of software engineering to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate \ncomputer software. Engineering techniques are used to inform the software development process which \ninvolves the definition, implementation, assessment, measurement, management, change, and improvement of \nthe software life cycle process itself. It heavily uses software configuration management which is about \nsystematically controlling changes to the configuration and maintaining the integrity and traceability of the \nconfiguration and code throughout the system life cycle. One of the main disciplines used in Software \nEngineering is Agile Workflow. Which-in comparison to Waterfall Workflow- is modular in all its steps, \nensuring a steady flow of output that is developed, designed, tested and implemented in separate blocks. \nCodescalers is a software company based in Belgium that is produced an up-and-coming software product to the \nmarket, and it follows the concepts of Agile to ensure a steady and efficient workflow and communication. The \ntesting team was my team of choice to be able to implement the methodologies that I have studied theoretically \nin Software Engineering course.   \n \nCodeScalers Egypt is the middle eastern branch of Codelscalers Belgium. Its mission is to develop promising \ntechnology for start-up companies in cloud computing and data centers. Their customers are high tech startups \nthat have found with CodeScalers Egypt a pool of talent that extends their R&D organizations. It houses a team \nof highly-skilled engineers that work hand in hand with the Belgian home office in order to maintain and deliver \nhigh quality code that services their products. Their main product-which is the one I have participating in its \ntesting- is ThreeFold Grid. ThreeFold Grid is a revolutionary service that acts as a versatile platform to rent and \nhost servers. It focuses on decentralization, gaining it an advantage over mega scale data centers around the \nworld. It has incorporated a multitude of third-party services in order to be more convenient, from all types \nhosting services to cryptocurrency payment.  \n \nAt first we were introduced to the technology stack used in Codescalers which was based on Golang which is a \ntesting-oriented language. My fellow interns and I were prompted to put our knowledge to the test using a \nsimple file parser project. We were then asked to implement a RESTful API with Golang and a full functional \nfront-end with it too. It followed hosting said website on Docker. All of the aforementioned was co-ordinated \nwith team leaders using GitHub and GitHub actions. Then the Quality Assurance team, which I have joined, \nprepared introductory talks about software testing and quality assurance frameworks such as Cypress and \nSelenium. I had hands-on experience using them on the test project with scopes of manual and unit testing. \nThen we were prompted to use these frameworks on the actual product, ThreeFold Grid and all its portals \n(Terraform and Terratest) aiding the QA team in finding bugs and issues with the product and trying to solve \nthem. \n \nI have gained hand-on experience in software quality assurance and testing methodologies using manual, unit \nand performance testing. I have gained practical knowledge on implementing said methodologies using Cypress \nand Selenium with Python. I have learnt to code in Golang from scratch and have gotten fluent in it. I \ncommunicated positively with the rest of the team in Scrum meeting to  identify issues in code, which were \nreviewed using GitHub and GitHub actions. It exceeded my expectations because I had both hand-on \nexperience on previously theoretical information gained at university, such as Agile Workflow, Web \ndevelopment, software testing, problem solving and using version control software, and got to know booming \n\x0c   \n \n   \n5 \nStudent Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt \nprogramming languages and frameworks that I did not use before. I think now I am considering a career in QA, \nand I wasn't before because I did not know how it was going practically, but only theoretically from university \ncourses. The main courses were Software Engineering CSEN603, Advanced Computer Lab CSEN 704, \nAnalysis and Design of Algorithms CSEN 703 and Computer Science I, II, III and IV courses. \n \n \nThe software quality assurance sector is very interesting and in demand, requiring skill to be able to correct \nand rectify the work of other developers to meet business needs. I could not have considered a career in QA \nunless I tried it hands-on at Codescalers Egypt, otherwise, it would have remained just theoretical knowledge. \nThe environment at Codescalers was very friendly and helpful, with seniors, juniors and team leaders guiding \nme and my fellow interns to gain more knowledge and solve real-world problems. I would definitely like to \nthank SCAD office for inviting them to the career fair, and everyone at Codescalers for their immense help. I \nwould definitely like to work there again sometime. \n \nPlease rate your satisfaction with the internship experience. \n Very satisfied           \xe2\x98\x90 Somehow satisfied             \xe2\x98\x90 Neutral       \xe2\x98\x90 Somehow dissatisfied        \xe2\x98\x90 Very dissatisfied  \nWould you recommend this internship to other colleagues?  \nYes                         \xe2\x98\x90 No                                    \xe2\x98\x90 Maybe \n \nReferences: (If any external sources are used, provide references for any information quoted) \n \nAppendices: (Upon availability, charts, pictures, etc.) \n \nDisclosure / Confidentiality Agreement \n \nThis agreement is to acknowledge that the information provided by any company / organization during the internship is unique to \nthis business and confidential. \nTherefore, anyone reading this agreement agrees not to disclose any of the information provided during the internship without \nnotifying & taking the employer\xe2\x80\x99s / supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s approval. \n   \n \n"
