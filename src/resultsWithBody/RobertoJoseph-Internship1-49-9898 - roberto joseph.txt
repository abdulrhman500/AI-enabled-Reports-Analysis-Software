b'Internship student report \nThe aim of writing this report is to focus on everything I have tackled during this internship. I was \nsearching for backend engineer internship for a long time and when I got the chance of this \ninternship at Tanmeyah I had to experience a new things for the first time. And to put in the work \nthat I take in the university into real life applications. I will be giving a brief summary about the \ncompany. Also the tasks and activities I did during the period of the internship. At the end I will be \nevaluating my time at the internship in my point of view. \nTanmeyah established in 2009, It is for Microenterprise Services leading provider of Microfinance \nsolutions in Egypt. Since its inception, Tanmeyah has grown rapidly to become one of the leading \nentities in the field of working capital financing for owners of low-income generating projects. The \nmission of the company is to bring banking and financial services to the underprivileged members \nof society and its vision is the Financial success and opportunities for ambitious, hardworking \nlower-income business owners, who contribute to a growing economy. Tanmeyah is a strong \nbeliever in these hard-working and entrepreneurial Egyptians, By helping them start or scale their \nbusinesses, it will boost employment and improve the standard of living of their families and \ncommunities. Three factors enable Tanmeyah to successfully serve clients overlooked by the \nbanking sector: highly personal service by dedicated well trained staff, nationwide reach, state-of-\nthe-art technologies. Tanmeyah\xe2\x80\x99s reach is supporting customers across 25 governments in Egypt. \nTanmeyah offers its leading Microfinance platform to third-party financial institutions enabling \nthem to reach new and under-served clients. As part of EFG Hermes\xe2\x80\x99 Non-bank Financial \nInstitutions platform. \nAt the beginning our supervisor \xe2\x80\x9cSenior backend engineer\xe2\x80\x9d gave me a tour in the factory and the \nother facilites. He gave me brief description about different fields in the company and how they \nwork together. Then he sent me to the Senior backend engineer that I am going to deal with him the \nwhole internship period. The backend of the company at first was using ASP.net and C# for \ndeveloping their website but They started to change to other technologies which is Java Spring \nBoot. The senior engineer started to give me tasks that had to be done using these new technologies. \nThe whole internship was about developing core-banking system which simulates as the actual real \none of the company using Java Springboot. He started giving me a simple task of making endpoints \nat the beginning of the internship I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a good background about Springboot and How can I \ndevelop endpoints and handle APIs. I started to ask my senior engineer questions and watching \n\x0ccourses about Springboot and JPA. After the first week I started to implement the first part of the \nsystem which signup users and handling transactions used by them, also I started to read more about \nSpring security which I used in my internship as to put more security in my application using JSON \nWEB TOKEN (JWT). My working day was that I took the task given by senior engineer then \nstarted to research for how to implement it and I have a video describes how my day was in this \ninternship https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEmYhQ8lTPw. And here is my GitHub repository \nof showing my tasks of this internship you can check it https://github.com/RobertoJoseph/\nCorebanking-Backend-Service. \nI believe I have acquired new skills, for example as I implemented the whole internship task using \nnew technologies and I learned the JPA which helps us to design the database by using different \nmethods and creating the structure of the database using only the Java code. I learned how to deal \nwith other members in other teams and who should I report to  if I have a problem. I think that the \ninternship meet my expectations putting into consideration the period I got the most from an \nopportunity like this. I feel that finance companies will be one of my main dreams to work in. One \nof the main courses that affect my internship and helps me to speed up my tasks is Networks course \nwhich its project was to develop an eCommerce website. \nIn conclusion, this internship opened my mind more and my exposure to the Microenterprise\xe2\x80\x99s \ncompanies. I learned a new skill which is dealing with different peoples to explain my point of view \neven if they are not in the same field. \nReferences: \nTanmeyah: https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?\nheroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Aorganization%3A1043448&keywords=tanmeyah%20micro%20enter\nprise%20services&origin=RICH_QUERY_TYPEAHEAD_HISTORY&position=0&searchId=67d7\n3f0a-eb1c-4625-8686-394955052e1f&sid=eiI \n  \n\x0c\x0c\x0c'
