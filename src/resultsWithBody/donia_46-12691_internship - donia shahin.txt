The main purpose of this report I to cover my internship experience as a part of team of Unity 
game developers used in VR experience. The main reason for choosing this company was that I 
thought they offered new way of marketing through technology, which something future wise is 
important. Through this report, I will cover my experience including what I learned and how this 
influenced my future career.  I will mention the tasks that I was preforming and required to 
accomplish throughout my entire duration. Also, I will mention my expectation in the work field 
and company and the reality. Finally, a summary of all what were mentioned will be written. 
 
Ebers is a company where science is visualized through technology. They are a team of 
passionate designers, content creators, developers, and marketers. Their prime motive is to 
visually translate complex information to produce: digital health solutions, educational 
experiences, and marketing campaigns. They operate at the intersection of three realms of 
knowledge: science, art, and business. Their mission is to provide students, professors, 
researchers, healthcare professionals, and public people with visual tools that best suit for 
educational purposes, health care marketing, and public for better communication. They work on 
3D medical animations, interactive slides and web content, augmented reality, and virtual reality. 
 
First of all, the project I worked on was a VR experience development. First, I was introduced to 
the stages the project passes through. I understood that the first step is that the game designer 
works on a brief from the manager to make Game Design Document (GDD). Then, it is divided 
into sprints and teams. There were 3D team and development team. So as my intern was 3 
months during quarantine, I was lucky to pass through both teams. I worked on blender and 
maya for animation and modeling for vfx. These assets were used in unity. Then we integrated 
the VR with unity to create shooting game. This shooting game was for a medicine. The game 
showed how the medicine, which is the person playing, shoots the uncontrollable evil cells. The 
more you kill the evil cells the higher your score. And I was responsible on building the scene. 
 
What I gained from this internship satisfied and improved me in a way. I learned how projects 
work, how to work in a team, how to be coordinate, and how to interact. The internship turned 
out to be better than my expectations as I really learned many things that would help me in the 
future. They were so helpful and the experience was enjoyable. This made me feel save about my 
working space in the future. Regarding how it helped me in my studies, it introduced me to maya 
and unity even before using them, making it easy for me when it comes to using them. The most 
related courses are ACL and Computer Graphics which are really useful and related to the work 
field. 
 
To sum it up, the company really offers a new advantage to the market as it helps students, 
professors, educators, and most importantly medical fields, which offered me a great experience 
as I learned what I should have learned and more.  It improved my overall technical and social 
skills. I knew how to manage being in a work place and how important it is for a company. It 
was also a very good choice as it was really into my field, which makes me consider working in 
after graduation.
