b'This summer, I had the privilege of training in Orange Egypt, a telecommunications company \nwhose headquarters are located at Smart Village. Orange Egypt, formerly known as Mobinil, is \nthe oldest mobile network operator in Egypt, founded on March 4 1998. Orange is one of the \nworld\xe2\x80\x99s leading telecommunications operators with 140,000 employees worldwide, including \n78,000 employees in France and 5,000 employees in Egypt. The Group is present in 26 \ncountries and has a total customer base of 271 million customers worldwide, with 33.5 million \nactive subscribers in Egypt. Orange is also a leading provider of global IT and \ntelecommunication services to multinational companies under the brand Orange Business \nServices. Orange Egypt provides voice and data exchange services, as well as 4G, 3G, ADSL \nand broadband internet. Orange\xe2\x80\x99s vision is to \xe2\x80\x9caccelerate the digital development of the \nEgyptian society by providing innovative solutions & unmatched customer experience.\xe2\x80\x9d Its \nmission is "always in touch to connect what\xe2\x80\x99s essential in your life." Orange Egypt has \nsucceeded in attracting clients from various social and economic backgrounds by creating \nproducts that are suitable for everyone.  \nI was assigned to the team in the Technology Department responsible for the management and \nmaintenance of the various Orange sites across Egypt; which is the Operation Team. This team \ndeals with a huge amount of data detailing the conditions of the various sites and its \ncomponents as well as working with a set budget. They were working on the creation of a \ndatabase for easier access to the data as its gathered in excel sheets. For the first few days, I \nwas introduced to the work environment and had an overview of the information needed about \nthe sites and how the different sub teams work with each other on the different responsibilities. \nThen, I started working with 2 other interns under the supervisor on the database. I first started \nworking on the schema for the DB shown below. Then I started handling the excel sheets to \ncollect and organize the data to be able to manipulate it and finally I worked on the queries for \nthe DB. \n \n\x0c \nThe last day of the internship I was required to prepare a 5 mins presentation on my experience \nin the internship, which I did in front of other interns of the summer internship program. \nI am very grateful for this internship opportunity because it exposed me to a real-life work \nenvironment, and I felt very involved and welcomed in the team. One of the most important skills \nthat I have improved during this internship was self-learning, since I had to learn about Pandas \nto deal with the data that will be used for the database. Another thing that I found interesting to \nlearn about was the management part of the decisions they had to make regarding the sites \nbased on the outcome of the analyzed data. Which gave me the idea of taking management-\nrelated courses after I graduate in order to expand my horizons for job opportunities. This \ninternship has certainly met my expectations; everyone was very helpful and cooperative and I \nlearned a lot from my supervisors. The internship experience has influenced my future career \nplans in the sense that it helped me discover a new application for my CS knowledge; which is \nin the telecommunications sector.  \nI definitely relied on some of the courses that I was taught in the university for the internship \nwhich were: Data Base I, Data Bases II, Software Engineering, Introduction to Communication \nNetworks, and Operating Systems. I would most definitely recommend this experience to other \nGUC students as it was extremely beneficial in so many aspects and I would certainly do it \nagain if I was given the chance. \nTo sum up, this internship has taught me a lot, and by designing a product myself, I felt \ngenuinely engaged in the workplace. I was also introduced to a new CS concept that I became \nproficient in. Through being present every day in the office, I was able to get further knowledge \nabout how the day-to-day operations are run. Because of how dedicated and helpful everyone is \nto one another; I think Orange Egypt is the best telecommunications company. \n\x0c \n\x0c \n\x0c\x0c'
