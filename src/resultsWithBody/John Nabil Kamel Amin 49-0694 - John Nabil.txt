           Being a computer engineer gives you the confidence to address a wide range of talents, from building 
a simple database to developing real websites with a backend and front end that users can interact with. I 
applied for this internship because it would help my career, allow me to transition into a new period, let me 
understand and analyze market demands, and teach me how large corporations operate. This report will 
include a brief summary of Orascom Construction PLC, my role on their team, the duties I was assigned, 
and the learnings I made from the experience. 
 
           Orascom Construction PLC (OC) is an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor 
based in Cairo, Egypt. The company was Egypt's first multinational corporation and stands at the core of the 
Orascom Group companies. OC is active in more than 25 countries. OC was established in Egypt in 1950 
and owned by Onsi Sawiris. It owned and operated cement plants in Egypt, Algeria, Turkey, Pakistan, Iraq, 
North Korea, and Spain, which had a combined annual production capacity of 21 million tons. Orascom 
Services grew to serve many vital sectors in the Egyptian market through its wide portfolio covering 
multiple industries including construction, infrastructure, industrial manufacturing, and agriculture. 
 
My colleagues and I began the internship by studying the principles of object-oriented programming 
(OOP). Then we were given the task of creating a completely functional website for a To-do list utilizing a 
database-first approach and Model-View-Controller principles. We utilized ASP.Net C# as our backend to 
create our models for our books, with the author and user establishing database schemas and producing them 
using code rather than manually writing SQL. Furthermore, we developed APIs for every function required 
for the website's control. Following that, we began using Express-Node.js for the website's backend, linking 
the website to our APIs. Finally, for the website's frontend, we used HTML and CSS. Our supervisor was 
extremely satisfied of our To-do list because it achieved all CRUD operations. 
 
This internship has provided me with a wealth of fresh experiences. First and foremost, working in a 
new team with fresh faces and being collaborative with one another with the same goal in mind, which is to 
get the finest result that satisfies our customer. Second, having to investigate everything was a bit difficult 
since it was difficult to describe what you truly wanted in Google's search box, but I learned how to search 
with the proper terms and not constantly rely on our supervisor because he had work to do. This internship 
exceeded my expectations since it provided me with fresh contacts and hands-on experience in real-world 
job circumstances. Although we are utilizing multiple programming languages, the ACL course is the most 
relevant to our internship. 
Finally, I'd want to thank Orascom Construction PLC for this wonderful chance and experience. I 
think I have reached a new turning point in my life. I've learnt a lot of useful stuff, both technical and 
personal. I was able to extend my network and witness how a large team works effectively to produce 
consistently and successfully in order to revolutionize the construction industry in Egypt and around the 
world.
