Sumerge is a leading software development company in the MENA region, \nspecializing in governmental and banking sectors. Their projects have shown great impact on \nvarious societies and I strive to do the same once I graduate. In this report, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be going over \nthe tasks and responsibilities that were assigned to me and what challenges I faced. \n \nIn this internship, I was introduced to two IBM tools which are Business Process \nManagement (BPM) and Operational Decision Manager (ODM) that were being used in the \nAlexBank CLUI project. BPM (considered Frontend and Middleware) is an IBM tool used to \nbuild the user interface and divide all the complex banking processes into separate concise \nsingular processes. These can then be added on top of each other to form the entire CLUI \nprocess, which is the banking process of having people apply for a loan/credit card etc.  \n \nODM on the other hand can be considered as the backend of the entire process of \nCLUI. It carries all the needed rules of the business regarding interest rates, required \ndocuments etc. This tool is beneficial for a business as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need a developer on site all \nthe time to change any business rule. There is a dedicated portal that allows normal bank \nemployees to adjust the rules using natural English vocabulary, which makes it easier for \nmost customers. \n \n \n \nMy team was working with an agile framework and would take 2 week sprints, where \nwe have to start a testing cycle at the end of the sprint. This testing process was tedious and \ntiring for the quality assurance team. So, with my manager\xe2\x80\x99s approval I took the initiative of \ndeveloping a automated testing for these testing processes. Where the tester is only required \nto check the end result reports and not run the test scenarios individually. This initiative is \nnow being discussed to be made as a sellable service for any company that wants to automate \ntesting on regular software releases. The software used for this was Robotic Process \nAutomation (RPA), using tools such as Power Automate, UIPath and Selenium. \n \n \nDuring last year\xe2\x80\x99s internship I lacked the skill of taking initiatives and leading people \nin projects to deliver the best possible output. Thankfully, during this internship I worked on \nthese weak points and was able to work with a magnificent team of special people from \nSumerge. I had already experienced how it feels to be a part of Sumerge so coming back for a \n\x0csecond year felt like a warm welcome back. The activities in this internship really benefited \nme in learning how real-world businesses want a product to be built for their needs and how \nunderstanding and planning what the customer wants is a crucial part of building software. \nNot to mention the immense teamwork skills that I gained over the two months to \ncommunicate daily and try to brainstorm the best solutions. \nTo conclude, I\xe2\x80\x99m thankful I got invited back to intern again at a great company like Sumerge. \nI\xe2\x80\x99m also thankful for the experiences I earned from working with a team of professionals \ndaily, trying to build a very complex product and deliver the best output every week. I\xe2\x80\x99ve \nseen that the software industry is a very competitive market, especially in the middle east as \nthe region is ripe for development regarding digitalization and automating human tasks \nacross all work fronts. I still have a long way to go regarding experience in the industry and \ngetting familiar with more tech stacks and technologies that are on the rise. \n \n\x0c"
