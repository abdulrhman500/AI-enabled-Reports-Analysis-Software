b'Internship Report \n \nThis report will be the summary of my journey as an IT intern, summer 2022, at MIDOR (Middle East \nOil Refinery). Technically, this was my first internship ever. I have gained much experience from this \ninternship and I have learnt much along the way.  It was mainly an IT internship but little did I know \nabout the IT department in big companies as there was much to learn and work there. In this document I \nam going to walk you through my journey at MIDOR, starting by a little overview of the organization, \nthen to the tasks I have performed there and finally to my internship evaluation. \n \nMIDOR, Middle East Oil Refinery, is an Egyptian shareholding company established on 12/07/1994 \nunder the Ministerial decree NO. 323 in accordance with the General Free Zone regulations and the \nInvestment Law No. 230 of the year 1989 and its amendments; with the aim of performing the activity \nof refining crude oil and producing high-quality petroleum products, for domestic and international \nmarkets. In order to support the Egyptian national economy, MIDOR\xe2\x80\x99s scope of activities has been \nextended during the last few years to include trading activities as purchasing and selling crude oil, \nproducts and petroleum derivatives, domestically and internationally. The company\xe2\x80\x99s head office is \nlocated in North Teseen street. \n \nAt my first day in MIDOR me and my colleagues got introduced to the company values and ethics by \nMr. Amr Shaaban, the General Manager of IT department. He then introduced us to the IT department \nthat is divided into three sub-departments: IT Operations, Cyber Security and Networks and \nCommunications. I chose to go for the IT operations where I was, for the first time, introduced to \nMicrosoft Active Directory. Our mentor, Mr. Hossam, taught us much about the Active Directory and \nMicrosoft Windows Servers during the first two weeks. The last two weeks were practical. The \ncompany provided us with some PCs to simulate a company\xe2\x80\x99s system where we had one device as the \nserver and the others simulated admins and users. Also, we were exposed to their on-ground servers and \ndata center as well as their on-cloud data centers provided and supported by Microsoft. \n\x0cDuring my 4-week internship there, I have learnt how a company or an entity\xe2\x80\x99s data system is managed, \ncontrolled and secured. I have gained experience on how to deal with Microsoft Windows Servers and \nhow to make good use of them. First, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect much from this internship since the company\xe2\x80\x99s core \nindustry is not related to my major. However, when I started my internship there, I have learnt that it is \ncrucial for big companies and institutions to have an IT department that manages and secures all the data \nthat is there whether on cloud or on-ground severs and that is all done using Microsoft Active Directory. \nAlthough the internship was not really related to any of my studies at college, I think it is somehow \ncorrelated to the Database I course. \n \nTo conclude, I would like to mention that it was pretty fun and informative experience. I have learnt \nmuch from my mentor and manager. They were very kind and provided us with lots of useful resources \nto learn from. At the end of my internship, I was rewarded a certificate in addition to trophy as an \nappreciation to our efforts. Simulating what happens in real systems and building a Microsoft server \nfrom scratch and connecting it to an Active Directory Domain, all worked by our hands, was a mind-\nopening experience to me and I am glad I have learnt about such technology as I always wondered how \nfor example the GUC manages all these PCs at once and limit access to certain functionalities on our \nstudent accounts. \n \n \n\x0cInternship Evaluation & Reporting \nTha~~ yo~ for taking the time to complete this form, this evaluation will be used to assess the student\'s \npart1c1pat1on in the internship program. \n~up~rv!sors, using the form below please evaluate the student who interned with your organization, \ninstitution, or business.
