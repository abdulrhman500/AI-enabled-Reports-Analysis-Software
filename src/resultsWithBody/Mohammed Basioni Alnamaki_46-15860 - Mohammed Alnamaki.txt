b"\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0cMohammed Basioni Alnamaki\nMET - CS\n46-15860\nInternship Report\nThis report's primary goal is to emphasize and describe the activities I engaged\nin during my internship at the German International University (GIU). I was a .NET\nsoftware engineer intern building the new university website. The most signi\xef\xac\x81cant\nreason for which I accepted this position is that I'm looking for a chance to implement\nthe theory information I've acquired during my studies in the MET department and the\nwillingness to learn about the process of developing a lasting project Real users' hand,\nthat is. This report's initial section will include a concise summary of the organization's\noperation. I'll then discuss the projects and duties I was given to complete during my\ninternship. The area after that would be for the internship evaluation. I'll wrap up this\nreport with a succinct summary.\nGerman International University (GIU) is a private international university with\nits headquarters in the New Administrative Capital. Currently, hundreds of students\nare served by seven distinct faculties. I worked with numerous new tools and\ntechnologies during my internship in the website team, which undoubtedly improved\nmy skills in many areas. Initially, I have some experience working with the Microsoft\nframeworks like .NET, which has recently gained greater popularity in the web\ndevelopment sector. The programming language \xe2\x80\x9cC#\xe2\x80\x9d, which is used to create a .NET\napplication, has also been introduced to me. I have also implemented an API that can\ngather data from the database and make it available via API that other working teams\ncan use to get the needed data. I was also one of two leaders of this team which gave\nme experience in managing a team with several developers and tasks. So we evaluated\neach member of the team as the members are not from the same study year. Then, we\nassigned tasks based on the evaluation. I also supervised them when integrating the\ntasks.\n\x0cThe internship exceeded my expectations as I learned a lot of tools and\ntechnologies in a small period of time. I also learned software product management\nprinciples and UI/UX guidelines. The best thing about the internship is that it was\nhighly related to my \xef\xac\x81eld and studies. I used the Agile method taught to me in the\nSoftware Engineering course. Also, I created and managed databases which I learned\nabout in two database courses: CSEN 501, and CSEN 503.\nIn conclusion, it was a good experience to have this internship. I had the chance\nto work on a software project that was intended for actual users. I also have a tonne of\nexperience with several tools that are frequently used in software engineering,\nespecially in our software market in Egypt. As valuable, the additional technical\nknowledge\ngained\nduring\nthe\ninternship\nmight\nbe\nconsidered\nto\nbe\nproject\nmanagement experience.\n"
