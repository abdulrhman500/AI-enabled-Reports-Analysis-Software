b"\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0cInternship Report\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that information technology is one of the most important and necessary fields\nin this day and age. Since I started pursuing a computer engineering bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s, I was always\ncurious as to how a huge business with multiple projects implements the use of software\ndevelopment to help manage its various departments, as well as make their employees\xe2\x80\x99 day-to-day\ntasks easier. For that reason, I pursued an internship in one of the biggest EPC companies in the\nworld: Orascom Construction. In this report, a brief description of the company and what it does, the\ntasks I did throughout my stay, and an overall evaluation of the internship will be provided.\nOrascom Construction PLC (OC) is a leading global engineering and construction contractor\nwith a footprint covering the Middle East, Africa and the United States and operations encompassing\nthe infrastructure, industrial and commercial sectors. The Group owns 50% of BESIX Group,\ndevelops and invests in infrastructure opportunities, and holds a building materials and facilities\nmanagement portfolio. OC was established in Egypt in 1950 and owned by Onsi Sawiris. The\ncompany was Egypt's first multinational corporation and stands at the core of the Orascom Group\ncompanies. Today, OC is active in more than 25 countries. In the first half of 2022 alone, Orascom\nConstruction reports a revenue of USD 1.9 Billion and EBITDA of USD 92.9 Millions.\nMy internship at OC lasted a total of six weeks. To make the most out of it, I was a part of\ntwo teams under the IT department: Research and Development (RnD) and Project Management.\nWith RnD, I learned about the technologies used throughout the department, including Angular,\n.NET CORE, and Microsoft SQL. My first task was to study the aforementioned technologies and\nuse them to create a fully-functioning website with trivial data. After being done with that, I was given\na task to shadow the development of an in-house application. Finally, my last task with RnD was to\ncreate an SQL database using Entity Framework Core that contains a list of URLs used by the\ncompany and a functioning Windows Service Program that checks the URLs from said database\nperiodically and sends an alert email with the type of connection error when one is faced. As for my\ntasks with the Project Management team, I have learned how coordination between users and\ndevelopers happens in the work field. I helped arrange and attended meetings on an almost daily\nbasis, where I had to write down the requirements needed for a system being developed or updated,\nand coming to a conclusion with the development team responsible for that system. Moreover, I\nused an in-house application to coordinate user requests or even handle them myself sometimes.\nI have learned multiple new technologies as well as used some I have already learned in the\nGUC. In addition to learning the technologies mentioned previously, I have learned a great deal\nabout analyzing situations and coming up with efficient solutions. Moreover, I have learned how to\nwork as a part of a bigger team, all moving forward towards the same goal. This internship has\nopened my eyes to the various fields inside the Information Technology sector. I believe the\nexperience I have gained will help me in my future career greatly as I would know what to expect\nfrom a job in this field. Needless to say, the internship was very relevant to my studies. The various\nprojects I had throughout my study period at the university helped me a lot as I was already very\nfamiliar with coding and development. Many of the courses I have taken proved to be helpful in my\ninternship. The ones that stood out the most were Databases I and II, Software Engineering, and\nData Structures and Algorithms.\n\x0cOverall, I would say I am very satisfied with the internship. I was exposed to the work\ncomputer engineers do. I believe joining a company in a sector like construction will prove to be very\nuseful as I now know that no matter what sector a business operates in, information technology is a\nkey factor. Any company needs an efficient database to keep track of all its projects, systems on\nwhich documenting said projects would be simple to do, applications to make tedious everyday tasks\nmore simple and accurate, and an IT department to be responsible for all of that.\n"
