And that what happened exactly I took so much information and \nexperience that will help me a lot to have a very good work in the future. They taught me more \nabout Robotics process automation (RPA) & programming languages & web development. I got \nmore experience in dealing with complex problems, analyzing them till I find a solution for \nthem. Automating tasks & creating bots was the main purpose to this internship. This report \nincludes review from the company about me and a review from me about them, what I made in \nthe internship and if I recommend this intern or not. \n- The internship was with First Gulf Solutions (FGS) Company remotely from home. FGS is an \nInformation Technology company offering niche Solutions and Services in End User Computing \nincluding Internet of Things (IoT), Student Information System, Cyber Security, HR Operation \nSolutions, Big Data & Business Analytics, Paper Control, Backup&DR, Cloud&SAAS, Digital \nProcess Automation, and Enterprise Information Management. FGS provide clients all the types \nof Web and IT services they need serving customers across Saudi Arabia and Egypt spread \nacross various industry verticals. FGS priority is to deliver a unique and simple experience for \ncustomers as they believe technology is their responsibility to provide the latest solutions to \nempower clients to achieve unlimited success, Partnering with the best of breed technologies. \n- The main purpose of this internship is how the Robotics process automation (RPA) can play an \nimportant role in automating tasks and avoiding manual adjustments which consume time and \nhuman-power and also role of RPA in banking and financial services, HealthCare systems, and \ninsurance.  So I started with learning about bots on www.automationanywhere.com site and how \nto program them like IQ bots, and I also know more about Automation Anywhere Robotic \nInterface (AARI) and Bot insight. At the end of the internship, I learnt how to enter data using \nautomation and how to automate simple tasks, optimizing automation value cycle by \nautomatically turning data into actionable insights (Bot insight) and dealing with IQ bots using of \nNatural Language Processing (NLP) to classify, extract and validate data from documents and \nemails to. To sum up, I learned more how to think and analyze problems and how to open my \n\x0cmind to think of ideas that will help using Artificial Intelligence and machine learning in real \nfields.  \n-I gained more skills in problem solving, developed my analyzing skills, automating bots, \ninserting data using automation and also what I got from researching about AI and RPA is how \nto get out with new ideas and implement them using AI. Also, I got more experience about \nArtificial Intelligence in our lives. The internship met my expectations. It will help me influence \nmy future career plans as AI field became an essential field nowadays. AI is core of Computer \nEngineering, as I will get a course about AI in a future semester, so it is good to have a lot of \nknowledge about it before taking the course \n- At the end, I learnt a lot in this internship, I became better in AI and usage of programming \ntools and how to solve complex problems and get out with new ideas that will help accelerating \nprocesses and satisfy the client. In addition, I got a lot of information about Artificial Intelligence \nand machine learning and how robotics automation can make more difference in many fields and \nsaving time and power. The company I took internship with is one of the most important \ncompanies in Egypt which offers many technological solutions especially AI chatbots, \ninformation management systems, business intelligence & analytics and digital process \nautomation. I applied on this internship through their website. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0c-Appendices:- \n \n \n\x0c \n \n \n\x0c \n"
