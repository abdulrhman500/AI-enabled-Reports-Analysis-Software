b"\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0cThe main purpose of this report is to inform SCAD office of my internship conducted in Flextock. The aim of doing this\ninternship was to gain more practical skills in regards to full-stack software engineering and web app development,\ntesting and deployment. Doing this internship in this sector leads to opening new opportunities in the future since the\nmodel of Flextock can be found applied in many companies or atleast a similar model where fulfillment and\norder/product management are involved. The most famous example would be Amazon. Furthermore, this internship gave\nme the chance to experience the startup environment. This report contains an overview of my Internship where I will\ngive a description of Flextock, talk about the assigned tasks in detail, evaluate my internship and write a conclusion on\nthe entire experience.\nFlextock is a warehousing, fulfillment and e-commerce startup company. It is technology powered which means that it\nhas a team dedicated to creating and maintaining its own software rather than buying it from a software house. It started\noperations in 2020. They aim to manage the end to end fulfillment cycle on clients' behalf whom they refer to as\nmerchants, allowing them to focus solely on growing their business. Their mission is powering the next generation of\ncommerce in MEA. They manage the inventory, pick, pack and ship orders while giving real time visibility every step of\nthe way through their web application which the merchant uses to create orders. In short, they manage operations such as\nstorage, order creation, warehouse management and shipment on behalf of the client so the client can focus more on the\nmarketing and selling aspect without spending time and effort in these operations. This is the main business vertical out\nof 3 business verticals that Flextock has and it is served through flextock.com, operational in Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\nThe second vertical is Alkaseba vertical. In this vertical, Flextock manages the operations as they do normally however\nhere they act as a merchant where they own the inventory while outsourcing operations such as marketing and sales of\nthe product to what are called sellers. Sellers sell Flextock\xe2\x80\x99s inventory by finding customers and creating orders\naccordingly on seller.alkaseba.com, also operational in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Flextock then delivers the goods to the\ncustomer and then gives the seller their profit. The third vertical is a backyard sale where they sell their own inventory on\na website however we were not provided with that website\xe2\x80\x99s link and this vertical is not really paid attention to since\nthere are no major developments happening to it.\nI worked in the Tech department which is responsible for developing software (web application) features, testing and\ndeployment. Inside the department we are divided into 5 squads. Most squads contain 4 members and each squad is\nresponsible for a set of features/modifications/fixes/optimizations assigned at the sprint planning phase. Each sprint is\ntwo weeks. And at the end we present all the work we did to the stakeholders. My squad was responsible for the\nAlkaseba website among other things. Personally I worked mainly on the Alkaseba website along with the Alkaseba\nadmin website. We used Jira for task management and Github for version control. My typical workday was spent in\nFlextock\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters. The day started with the stand-up meeting that the entire company joins in to see the company\xe2\x80\x99s\nperformance the previous day. Afterwards, the tech team holds the morning sync meeting where everyone shares what\nthey did the day before and what they plan on doing today. Flextock has flexible hours and the meeting could be attended\n\x0conline. So my usual workday started at about 10:30 AM. In the tech department, we work with the hybrid workplace\nmodel, so I was able to take some days to work from home, however, most of the time I preferred going to the office. I\nworked on my own personal laptop, however with separate accounts created with my flextock email.\nIn my first week I was assigned learning tasks to help me learn the stack used. The company used Angular for front-end,\nDjango for back-end and postgres for the database. I was learning and applying my learnings by creating simple\ncomponents and also creating simple APIs and calling them from my front-end. The following week I worked on testing\nseveral implemented features including testing cart behavior when switching marketplaces (between Egypt and Saudi\nArabia), Testing synchronization between e-commerce websites such as shopify and flextock\xe2\x80\x99s portal, and checking that\naddress validation works correctly. I also worked on setting up a log in a specific function for debugging purposes. This\nmarked my first sprint.\nIn my second sprint I started working on my first feature. Features are typically divided into three phases:- Analysis,\nDesign and Implementation. And for each phase a task should be created on Jira and then worked on. In analysis, our\nteam discusses with the product (project management) team the technical feasibility of the task and gives a time estimate\nfor completing the task. The product team also provides us with the UI and UX design in this phase. In the design phase,\na technical design document is created by the developer that is assigned a feature, and then it is discussed with the whole\nteam. This document contains how the developer plans to implement the new feature and integrate the changes with the\nexisting system.\nIn Alkaseba, the seller creates an order, and this order has a status such as new, not verified, verified, canceled etc\xe2\x80\xa6. My\ntask was to add a field that showed the reason for the status which required adding a new table in the database as well as\nchanging the back-end and the front-end to accommodate the new change. This feature was required for the canceled and\nthe not verified statuses only. The \xe2\x80\x9ccanceled\xe2\x80\x9d status is obvious and it could be due to many reasons such as that the\ncustomer does not want the order anymore. The \xe2\x80\x9cnot verified\xe2\x80\x9d status is similar to putting the order on hold. It basically\nmeans that the order should not be confirmed yet. It could also be due to many reasons, such as the customer not\nanswering the phone calls which are made by the dedicated confirmation team to confirm the orders. The analysis phase\nwas quick as the feature was clear and feasible. I received the UI and UX design and started working. For this task I had\nto create the design document which showed the new table and how to retrieve the information in this table for the seller\nside as well as how to retrieve it in the order edit history from the admin\xe2\x80\x99s side. I received comments from the team and\nthe tech team head and then modified my work accordingly. I then went ahead and worked on this task with a squad\nmate. I was responsible for implementing the front-end in Alkaseba\xe2\x80\x99s admin portal, as well as creating the table in the\ndatabase. I also worked on Alkaseba front-end to modify the view according to the requirements by the product team\n(including adding the mobile phone view). In the admin portal, the admin selects on the cancellation/not verifying\nbutton, then a pop-up appears asking him to select the reason for choosing the status with an optional comment field.\nThen, upon saving, the status is updated and the reason is added. This entry can be seen from the seller side in the orders\ntable and from the admin side in the order status history section in addition to the orders table. The admin can also\nexclusively view the comment entered (if any).\n\x0cAs mentioned previously, a big part of the job was analyzing new features assigned by the product team. In my third\nsprint I was assigned the task of analyzing a new feature for flextock\xe2\x80\x99s main website (flextock.com) called Merchant\nAlerts. The idea behind it was to solve a problem that happened when the flectock merchant would create an order and it\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be synchronized to their e-commerce shop (on platforms such as shopify and woocommerce). Flextock\nintegrates the merchant portal with these e-commerce platforms in order to synchronize products and orders, and these\nsync problems would occur regularly because of issues regarding field entry. So merchant alerts were created to alert\nmerchants using notifications that there is an issue with the field they entered and they need to correct it to guarantee that\ntheir orders are synchronized. During this phase I had to collect a lot of information regarding the technicalities of\nsynchronization between our platform and the e-commerce platform and report this information to the product team in\norder to see the technical feasibility of this feature and the product team used the information to optimize the design of\nthis feature. After many iterations, the final conclusion was that it was not going to be implemented because it was\ndiscovered that the problem could be solved another way without involving the merchant.\nIn my fourth sprint, I worked on Alkaseba Content Change. This task was purely a front-end task. The company wanted\nthe website to be more accessible for the Saudi Arabian users, so they wanted to add text in the Saudi dialect that would\nshow up to users who had a Saudi IP. This task was done using localization. The website had no localized text before, so\nI had to do some research to decide on which package was going to be used for localization and then changed all the text\nfrom static to localized. This change was also done on the Alkaseba landing page alkaseba.com which is a separate\nproject using vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS (for search engine optimization purposes).\nAfter that I worked on the whatsapp confirmation project. To give a background, the company usually confirms orders\ncreated by the sellers on Alkaseba using phone calls to the customers made by a dedicated confirmation team. They\nwanted to create a whatsapp bot that takes some of the load from the confirmation team by sending confirmation\nmessages to the customers. I created the API that takes the new order status after confirmation/cancelation and updates\nthe status in Alkaseba system accordingly.\nAfter that, I was tasked with creating a new field in the order form called \xe2\x80\x9csecondary phone number\xe2\x80\x9d. It might look like a\nsmall change but a lot of things had to be changed in the back-end to accommodate for this addition such as validation,\nmaking the changes in the bulk order upload module (which was a separate project), and actually adding the field itself.\nAnother small task for this sprint was viewing a field called tracking number in the front-end of Alkaseba which was\nalready being sent from the back-end but not shown. I did these tasks completely independently (aside from consulting\nmy squad mates on some changes and some technical designs).\nI believe this internship has benefited me valuably and exceeded my expectations. I always say that this is the internship\nwhere I benefited the most. I made several friends and connections that could benefit me in the future, and I also learned\na lot on the technical side. I learned a whole new stack, and was also practically introduced to many concepts that I\nstudied in the Software Engineering CSEN603 and Computer Programming Lab CSEN401 courses. I saw how\nexperienced software engineers think about and solve problems and how they consider efficiency, time, readability and\n\x0cflexibility when writing code. I feel like I have sharpened my skill of quick learning and the skill of adapting to a new\nprocess, and I definitely improved my software engineering and code writing skills. In terms of how this internship\ninfluenced my career plans, I think it has re-ignited my passion for software engineering and development, and really\ngave me a fulfilling experience in terms of seeing how a software engineering team operates, especially considering that\nthere were no divisions such as front-end, back-end, testing or devops. Instead, everyone was a fullstack developer and\nresponsible for testing, deployment and optimization as well. Working on assigned tasks in sprints, taking a feature and\ncompleting its back-end and front-end was closely related to how we worked in the Advanced Computer Lab CSEN704\ncourse. It definitely helped me massively in terms of having the sufficient background to learn the stack that we used\nquickly. I would definitely say it is the most related course to this internship. Finally, I would easily recommend this\ninternship to any GUC MET student, and I would recommend Flextock in general to any GUC student.\nIn conclusion, this internship showed me a very defined view of the software engineering career. It enhanced my soft\nskills greatly and gave me friends and contacts for the future. Being part of an e-commerce driven company that uses and\noperates its own software and is completely dependent on the product of its own software engineering team was a great\nexperience for me, and it showed me how suitable this environment is for me. Being part of this startup environment\ngave me insights into many departments other than the software engineering/tech department and it gave me a deeper\nunderstanding of the business logic behind software, and apart from software, attending the daily stand-up meeting\nmentioned above gave me some interesting business insights. Working at Flextock and in the industry it\xe2\x80\x99s in also gave\nme a background in order creation, logistics and delivery systems and the states associated with them as well as what\nwould be needed software-wise to support them. This would be very beneficial as many companies depend on those two\nelements such as food apps or shopping apps. I was extremely satisfied with the overall experience.\n\x0cReferences:\nhttps://www.flextock.com/about.html\n"
