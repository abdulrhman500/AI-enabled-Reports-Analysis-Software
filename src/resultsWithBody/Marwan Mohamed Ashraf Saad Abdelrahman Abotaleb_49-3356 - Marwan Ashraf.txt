b' \n\x0c \n \n\x0c \n\x0c \n\x0cInternship Title: Backend Developer Intern \nCompany/Organization Name: Solarus Smart Solution \nThe purpose of joining the company was to get introduced to web-development which is the \nmost common field in the market. I found it crucial to get introduced to it and its aspects since it \nis having a broad and wide market and whatever I learn in that field will be used in any other \nfield since it has so many core concepts. Most importantly, I wanted to get introduced to the real \nworld and observe how everything operates by consuming as much knowledge as I can. The first \nsection talks about the companies aim, description and services they provide. The second part \ntalks about my experience there, task I have done, the environment, different technologies, skills \nand concepts I learned. The third part talks about my overview of the internship, how it helped \nme and how it will influence me in the future. \nThe companies aim is to help corporates to manage all smart business solutions. It has a sort of \nsub-company; Manex (https://web.manexcard.com/indexEn.html) where the internship took \nplace. Manex\xe2\x80\x99s main purpose is to help companies handle all their payable transactions \nelectronically, by using Manex smart system rather than manual transactions. It automates and \nregulates the process of making transactions and helps facilitate day to day tasks, such as \ntracking business daily expenses, analyzing the cost centers, financial controlling and \nsettlements. So, the system provides convenience and security for both companies and \nindividuals. Manex provides services to control and manage company expenses, such as fueling \nup company\xe2\x80\x99s cars, buying meals and equipment for employees and allocating budgets. \n \nFirstly, for my assigned tasks, initially I was assigned to learn about different technologies and \nconcepts we will be working with, since they will be the foundation of everything that will be \ndone in the future. Afterwards, I was handed the company\xe2\x80\x99s code and assigned to fix bugs, add \nnew features, look at user stories, analyze and implement them. My work would then be \nreviewed by my superior and accordingly added.  \nSecondly, work times were flexible but I am supposed to work 8 hrs./day. A normal day would \nstart off with a standup meeting at 11 am where all team members were present, each giving \ninsight of what they have done the previous day and what they should do on that day. After that, \n\x0cI would go on and finish my assigned tasks or do some research on helpful technologies I can use \nthat might be helpful to the company. When there is an emergency or urgent problem, all team \nmembers halt their work and gather in the meeting room to solve the problem whether it is an \narchitectural or design problem. Team consists of the following departments: backend, frontend, \nAndroid, quality. Each department has one or two Senior developer and a couple of juniors and \ninterns.  \n \nThirdly, Manex is web-based application built on java as a backend so the technology used for it \nwas Spring Boot. Manex code is built upon the microservice architecture and spring is a perfect \ntool to implement microservices in the BCE pattern. For the database, MYSQL was used and for \ntesting endpoints Postman and Swagger were the go-to choices. \n \nFourthly, I did a lot of research in order to have a good understanding of how a firm web-based \napplication is constructed. At the beginning, they were things as simple as SOLID principles, \ndesign patterns and microservice architecture and other programming principles, but as I went \ndeeper topic became more specific such as \xe2\x80\x9cHow caching works and how to implement caching \nin your application\xe2\x80\x9d. Before I hopped on the company\xe2\x80\x99s code I was asked to make a mini app \nusing spring while researching it to help me have a firm understanding .You can find here the \nGitHub link for the app (https://github.com/ContractI9/Spring-Microservice-bce) .Topics also \nincluded, setting up config servers and eureka servers for communication between services, \nREST, DTO\xe2\x80\x99s ,OOP ,AOP , TDD and a lot more back-end concepts. \nHere are some screenshots of the code I had written this can be found on the GitHub link above \ntoo:   \n\x0c \n \n \n \n \n\x0c \n \nThrough my internship I have acquired a couple of handy skills, one of them was the ability to \nwrite clean and structured readable code in order to be easily read and interpreted by others and \nmyself, working with a large-scale team and having to integrate work with them. The one that \nwill probably help me the most in the future is the ability to research and look for the information \nyou need, and how to correctly look for what u want and gather information from various \nsources. The internship met my expectations, since I gained a lot of experience and knowledge \nfrom it that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gained just from studying. Now since I experienced what it is like \nbeing a back-end developer, I would like to work in this field in the future since it really suits my \nskill set.  \nMost of the work done is correlated with my studies since studying computer engineering and \nimplementing web-based application somehow go hand in hand, where both share many \nconcepts and a lot of sophistications in web base applications are solved by having a computer \nengineering background. Most of the courses I took helped me in the internship but the ones that \nhad a large effect on my performance since I studied them and they are largely used in Manex \nare: Software Engineering, Databases 1 and 2, Data Structures and Algorithms, OS. \n\x0cI would Strongly advocate for anyone to join the company. \nFinally, it definitely was a new and fun experience to be able to do work and learn about the real \nworld. It boosted my coding and problem-solving skills heavily and gave me insight about how \nthe market operates and the importance of flexibility and acceptance of new technologies. I have \nalso learnt how the company is managed and the role and responsibility of every person from the \nintern to the senior developer up to the CEO. The company paved the way for me and introduced \nme to the market, I have acquired a lot of knowledge that will be beneficial to me in the future. \n \n \n\x0c \n'
