b"\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0cInternship Title: Internship in the IT department at NBE (The National Bank of Egypt) \nCompany / Organization Name: NBE (The National Bank of Egypt) \nThe purpose of this report is to describe and evaluate my summer internship at the \nNational Bank of Egypt as an MET student (Computer Science and Engineering major). I \nhave completed my internship at the National Bank of Egypt in the IT department which \nadded a lot of practical experience to me in the field that I\xe2\x80\x99m pursuing, which is web \ndevelopment. I feel honoured that I got exposed to the job market by experiencing to work in \na huge and deep-rooted corporation like the National Bank of Egypt, which has not only \nenriched me on the technical aspect, but also gave me a glimpse of the work life in a big \ncorporation and enriched me on that aspect as well.  \nNBE is the oldest commercial bank in Egypt. It was established on June 25, 1898 with \na capital of \xc2\xa3 1 million. Throughout its long history, NBE's functions and roles have \ncontinually developed to square with the different economic and political stages in Egypt. \nDuring the 1950s, NBE assumed the central bank's duties. After its nationalization in the \n1960s, it acted as a pure commercial bank besides carrying out the functions of the central \nbank in the areas where the latter had no branches. Moreover, since mid-1960s, NBE has \nbeen in charge of issuing and managing investment certificates on behalf of the government. \nNBE is one of the largest contributors to social responsibility among banks in Egypt. It \nbelieves that it has a significant role to play in improving the quality of life of Egyptians. \nSuch contributions were vigorously engaged in supporting healthcare, education, slums \ndevelopment, combating poverty, alleviating the distress of imprisoned indebted persons, and \nempowering disabled persons, as well as supporting culture and maintaining heritage. As a \nresult, NBE\xe2\x80\x99s contributions to social responsibility totalled EGP 9.3 bn. in 6 years. NBE is \nalways keen to deliver top-quality and cutting-edge banking services and products to its \nesteemed customers so that the Bank can maintain their precious confidence and continue its \nleadership in the local banking market. Link to NBE\xe2\x80\x99s website: https://www.nbe.com.eg/  \nDuring this internship, I was able to develop my skills in several technical fields. \nUsing technologies such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax Requests, Bootstrap, Object-\nOriented Programming, Java-hibernate, MySQL, I was able to create several projects from \nscratch which added a lot to both, my frontend as well as my backend development skills. \nOne of these projects is a reflexes game that measure how good is you reflex reaction based \non how fast you can press a popping shape that appears every certain time interval on a \n\x0cscreen. Another project is a full stack social media web application. In addition to that, I was \nable to have an overview on how banking applications work and how they are developed. A \ntypical working day starts at 8:00 am, our mentor starts explaining necessary concepts and \ntechnologies that we would need for working on the project that day, then there a lunch break \naround 12:00 pm, then we start implementing and working on the project for the rest of the \nday.   \nThis internship made me develop skills in web development, frontend and backend, as \nwell as soft skills that I gained from working with actual bank employees like negotiation \nskills, punctuality, and socializing in the work environment. Definitely, the internship met my \nexpectations and beyond. This internship will have a great influence on my future career \nplans as it opened my eyes on the importance of programming in the banking sector, and I \nwill for sure consider this field in the near future. The tasks in this internship were like a \npractical implementation to my studies in the university. Courses like Databases, Software \nEngineering, Object Oriented Programming (CSEN 401), and Introduction to Networks are \nthe most related to the internship.  \nIn conclusion, this internship has developed my hard and soft skills. For the hard \nskills, it gave me real-life experience in web development, Object-Oriented Programming and \nDatabases. It also made me experience the work environment in a big corporation which \nadded a lot to my soft skills. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that I was able to have the opportunity to intern in the \nNational Bank of Egypt as it is a great place to gain such experience from.  I am very \nsatisfied with this internship, and I would definitely recommend this internship in the \nNational Bank of Egypt to other GUC students. \n \n \n \n \n\x0cCERTIFICATE\nTHIS CERTIFICATION IS AWARDED TO\nRana Tarek Adel Ibrahim\nFor successfully Completing NBE Internship Program 2022 for the\nperiod from 14 AUGUST 2022 to 8 SEPTEMBER 2022\nDate: is Sept ember  2022\npi\nNATIONAL BANK OF EGYPT * 1'\nHuman Resources Group\nNational Bank of Egypt\n>uLLu\n"
