           Being a computer engineer gives you the confidence to address a wide range of talents, from building 
a simple database to developing real websites with a backend and front end that users can interact with. I 
applied for this internship because it would help my career, allow me to transition into a new period, let me 
understand and analyze market demands, and teach me how large corporations operate. This report will 
include a brief summary of QNB AlAhli, my role on their team, the duties I was assigned, and the learnings 
I made from the experience. 
 
In 2013, QNB Group purchased the controlling interest in NSGB Bank, which was formed in Egypt 
in 1978. Its name was changed to QNB ALAHLI, and it has since expanded its activities to provide 
exceptional banking services to individuals and corporate clients. In accordance with the privatization policy 
that began in 2005, the bank purchased 90% of Misr International Bank's stock for EGP 2.5 billion, allowing 
it to become Egypt's second-largest private bank in 2011. The bank built a number of subsidiaries in several 
specialist industries, which contributed to the bank's best standing in Egypt's financial and banking 
operations. The QNB ALAHLI vision is built on developing long-term relationships with clients and 
providing them with a diverse variety of products and services in order to fulfill the changing needs of 
individuals, corporations, and SMEs. 
 
My team and I started the internship by learning the fundamentals of OOP and famous code 
architecture patterns like the Model-View-Controller, Master-Slave, Peer-to-peer pattern and briefs of many 
other patterns. Then, we were assigned to build a fully functioning website for a library using code-first 
approach in Model-View-Controller patterns. We used ASP.Net C# as our backend for creating our models 
for our books, author and user creating the database schemas and generating it using the code without 
manually writing any SQL. In addition, we created APIs for every function we needed for the website in the 
controlling. Afterwards, we started using Ajax JavaScript for the backend of the website connecting the 
website with our APIs. Finally, we used HTML and Bootstrap for building the frontend of the website. This 
project took us our 4 weeks of the internship and our supervisor was very proud of our outcome for the 
library as it achieved all CRUD operations, search, login, security, log sheet, using tokens, and different 
levels of authority with different actions. 
 
 
 
In the duration of this internship, I have gained a lot of new experiences. First of all, working in a 
new team with new faces and being collaborative with each other having the same target which is achieving 
the best product that satisfies our client (our supervisor). Secondly, having to research everything was a bit 
hard to express what you really want in the Google’s search bar, but I learned how to search with the right 
keywords and not always depending on our supervisor as he had work to do. This internship exceeded my 
expectations as I made new connections and hands-on experience in real life work situations. The most 
related course to this internship is the ACL course, although we are using different programming language, 
but it is the same concept and the same pattern just different syntax. 
 
Finally, I'd want to thank QNB AlAhli for this wonderful chance and experience. I think I have 
reached a new turning point in my life. I've learnt a lot of useful stuff, both technical and personal. I was 
able to extend my network and witness how a large team works effectively to produce consistently and 
successfully in order to revolutionize the banking sector in Egypt and around the world.
