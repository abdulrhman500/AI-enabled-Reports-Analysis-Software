b' \n\x0c \n\x0c \n\x0c \n\x0cInternship Certificate \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0cNBE Internship Report \n- This report\xe2\x80\x99s main purpose is a confirmation that I made an internship for one month related to \nComputer Engineering field, my core field, that will impact in taking as much information and \nexperience as possible. And that what happened exactly I took so much information and \nexperience that will help me a lot to have a very good work in the future. They taught me more \nhow to research and get the important info. I got more experience and confidence in making \npresentations. Connecting AI with banking was the main purpose to this internship. This report \nincludes review from the bank about me and a review from me about them, what I made in the \ninternship and if I recommend this intern or not. \n- The internship was in National Bank of Egypt (NBE) which is the oldest commercial bank in \nEgypt, it was established in 1998. A while ago, as NBE is dedicated to enhancing the financial \ninclusion and digitization, NBE started in presenting several online banking services to cater \ntheir millions of customers via Al Ahly Net and Phone Cash wallets. Online banking eases a lot \nof services for the customers, so that NBE is trying as much to enhance apps using development. \nAmong Egyptian\xe2\x80\x99s banks, NBE is considered as one of the largest contributors in social \nresponsibility, as NBE believes that it has a major role to improve Egyptians\xe2\x80\x99 lives. Some of \ntheir contributions is in healthcare, education, conserving culture and helping to fight poverty. \n- The main purpose of this internship is how the Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play an important \nrole in enhancing banking services to be easier for the customers and to accelerate the banking \nprocesses. So as a team we started with making research about AI, its types, AI applications, AI \nin financial sector, machine learning and the impact of robotics process automation in finance \nand banking. After that we made presentations about the information we got from the research \nabout these topics and our ideas of enhancements. At the end of the internship, each member \nmade a presentation that concludes all the research we made and the new ideas, moreover, \nsearching for the impact of the AI on the other banks. To sum up, I learned more how to research \nand get the important info and how to open my mind to think of ideas that will help using \nArtificial Intelligence and machine learning in real fields as finance and banking. I got more \nexperience in making presentations as we made a lot of presentations. \n-I gained more skills in presenting what I got from researching about AI and machine learning \nand how to get out with new ideas and how to present them in a good way. Also, I got more \n\x0cexperience about Artificial Intelligence and its usage in our lives. The internship met my \nexpectations. It will help me influence my future career plans as AI field became an essential \nfield nowadays. AI is core of Computer Engineering, as I will get a course about AI in a future \nsemester, so it is good to have a lot of knowledge about it before taking the course \n- At the end, I learnt a lot in this internship, I became better in presenting and how to make good \nresearch and get out with new ideas that will help accelerating processes and satisfy the client. In \naddition, I got a lot of information about Artificial Intelligence and machine learning and how \nrobotics automation can make more difference in banking and finance field in the future. The \nbank I took internship in is one of the largest banks in Egypt. NBE made a significant \nenhancement in online banking services as Al Ahly bank and Phone Cash wallets. Online \nbanking was based on AI and development (cores of Computer Engineering). I applied through \ntheir website. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0c-Appendices:- \nFirst presentation \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0c \nSecond presentation \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0c \nThird presentation \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0cFourth presentation \n \n \n \n \n\x0cFifth presentation \n \n \n'
