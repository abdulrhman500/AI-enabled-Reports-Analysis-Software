The second set of tasks included developing official \nwebsites for the organization in several countries using Drupal, an open-source web content management \nsystem.  The third and last task was the major task, which was to create a full-stack web-based application on \nVisual Studio using ASP.NET Core Framework and C#. This meant that I had to create the program from the \nground up, from the simplest backend function to extract data from the database to a fully functional user \ninterface.
