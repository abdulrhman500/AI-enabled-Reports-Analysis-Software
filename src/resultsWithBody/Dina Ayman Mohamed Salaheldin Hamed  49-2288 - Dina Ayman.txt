b'\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0cThe aim of this report is to describe the internship I have done in iotblue company\nconsidering the tasks assigned to me, experiences gained and the general purpose of the\ncompany itself. The objective of this internship is to learn how to use my technical skills in\nthe field of IoT which is a field of my interest.\nOutline:\n1.\nDescription of the company\n\xe2\x97\x8f\nCompany\xe2\x80\x99s mission and vision\n\xe2\x97\x8f\nField of the company\n\xe2\x97\x8f\nProducts and services\n2.\nInternship activities\n\xe2\x97\x8f\nWorking conditions\n\xe2\x97\x8f\nTasks and researches\n\xe2\x97\x8f\nTools used\n3.\nEvaluation of the internship\n\xe2\x97\x8f\nSkills gained\n\xe2\x97\x8f\nInfluence on future career\n\xe2\x97\x8f\nCorrelation with your studies\n4.\nConclusion\n\xe2\x97\x8f\nWhat is derived from the internship experience?\n\xe2\x97\x8f\nGeneral observations about the company\xe2\x80\x99s specialisation\niotblue is an Innovative technology company that helps businesses harness the power of IoT\nin order to build possibilities and achieve opportunities. Through their low-code Cervello IoT\nplatform, not only do they provide IoT products but also services that overcome sustainability\nchallenges, promote the democratisation of technology, and enable digital and industrial\ntransformation. Their goal is to empower businesses, professional developers, and citizen\ndevelopers with the tools they need to seamlessly adopt and use IoT in their everyday\noperations. They also put their own signature by keeping their products and services always\nup to date. Their website is https://iotblue.com/ .\nThroughout the internship I was with the backend team and was assigned by my supervisor\ndifferent tasks in distinct projects according to the sprint. A task may take about several days\nor weeks accordingly, so every working day I would spend my hours in the office doing part\nof the task and upon finishing the task I do a pull request for my branch on bitbucket to have\n\x0cmy task reviewed and merged by my supervisor. Considering the tasks assigned to me, as a\nstart I had to do research on hexagonal architecture and its application as it will be used in all\nprojects. Furthermore, I did an ERD for a new web application, converted this ERD to an\nactual database using postgresql on pgadmin and worked on its API. For the API, I was\nassigned to use node.js, javascript language on webstorm and sequelize to link the application\nto the database. Illustrating, my task was to create a code by javascript that does the features\nstated in the use case, in which each feature includes mapping the http request to the logic\nand handling it then the response is shown in the database and the http response.Afterwards, I\nwas assigned to do research on normalization and denormalization  as well as a presentation\non that topic. In addition, I had a task to add a specific feature in one of the company\xe2\x80\x99s\nalready existing APIs using javascript.After this, my next task was to replace part of an\nexisting API from go language to typescript with the same logic, architecture and\nresponses.For this task I used dbeaver to monitor the effect on database , node on webstorm,\ntypeORM to link application to database  and postman to compare responses. Lastly, I\nresearched and presented the topic of serverless computing.\nThis internship had a great impact on my skills as it improved my problem solving,\npresentation, technical, teamwork, flexibility and searching skills by the given tasks. This is\nas interacting with others, working with a language, library, architecture or an IDE that I have\nnever used before, trying to reach a specific goal were all mandatory in each task. I was very\nsatisfied with the internship experience. As for influencing my future career plans, I think that\nI got a greater view and wider understanding of the IoT technology as well as the different\nroles and types of developers which is helping me on setting my mind upon the jobs and\nfields of work that best suits me and the courses I can take in the future.Being very related to\nmy studies,this experience gave me the chance to have a real life application to my studies.\nFor example, using postgresql that we studied in databases 2 course, javascript, node and http\nfrom the networks course, the architectures from the software course, ERD from database 1\ncourse and coding and OOP from CSEN 1, 2, 3 and 4 courses.Finally, I would highly\nrecommend this company to other GUC students.\nTo sum up, through the different tasks and the company environment in this internship\nexperience I have enjoyed practising my skills as well as acquiring new ones. In addition to\nhaving a real life application on what I have been learning at university and having a wider\nunderstanding of how work life is. Furthermore, I got to know about IoT technology which is\n\x0cthe main specialisation of the company and how it is related to our surroundings. IoT can be\nshown as a network of physical objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and other\ntechnologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and\nsystems over the internet which  can be used in a wide range of functionalities.\n\x0c'
