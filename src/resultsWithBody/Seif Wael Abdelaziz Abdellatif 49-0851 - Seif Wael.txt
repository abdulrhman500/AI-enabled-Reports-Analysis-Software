b'\x0cSeif Wael Abdelaziz\xe2\x80\x99s Internship Report\n49-0851\nApplication Team Intern at the Information Technology Department\nMarakez Company for Real Estate\nThis report\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is to discuss and describe my one month Summer 2022 Internship at\nMarakez Company for Real Estate as an Application Team Intern at the Information Technology\nDepartment. The objective of performing this internship in this company specifically was that\nwhile I was searching for an Internship and sending my CV everywhere, I got two offers, one\nfrom Marakez and another from another company. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about Marakez at first but when\nI visited their website I found out that it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge company that is managing over 1.5 million\nsquare meters of prime retail real estate spread across a network of 21 shopping malls, so the first\nthought I had in my mind was that for a first Internship, this would be a huge step for my career\nto see how a huge company operates and observe a well put together system, so that I can start to\nbuild myself into an employee that can fit in a similar one as a developer. In this report I will\ndiscuss the company\xe2\x80\x99s description, the tasks I performed in the internship, the internship\xe2\x80\x99s\nevaluation and a summary of the key conclusions derived from the internship experience.\nMarakez is leading the Mixed-used developer market in Egypt, with a huge portfolio of\ncommercial and residential projects including;  Mall of Tanta, Mall of Arabia, Aeon towers,\nTown Center, , District Five,  D5M, Mall of Mansoura and Mindhaus Offices ; bringing\nexperience from a dynamic team of experienced and innovative Egyptian professionals.\nFawaz Al Hokair\xe2\x80\x99s group is the holding company of Marakez, founded in 1989, currently\noperates 80 international fashion brands and more than 2,100 stores across 16 countries.\nThe group is a multinational conglomerate that focuses on five main sectors: fashion retail,\nshopping centres, F&B, entertainment and hotels. Managing over 1.5 million square meters of\nprime retail real estate spread across a network of 21 shopping malls. The group\xe2\x80\x99s current\ninvestments span across the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, USA and Central Asia making it\none of the largest retail and real estate developers in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. My\ninternship was based at Marakez\xe2\x80\x99s Ain El Sokhna road\xe2\x80\x99s District Five head office.\n\x0cDuring my one month Internship at Marakez I had multiple tasks to show my skills and\nknowledge at, including my knowledge in SQL programming language used in databases which I\nused when Marakez was opening a cafe at their Head Office there at District Five which was\ncalled Villa M, we needed to update the prices of the products sold, so I used Visual Studio and\nmade some SQL queries with the help of two Senior Engineers to update the database so that the\ncafe\xe2\x80\x99s system is updated. Also I had tasks to work on a Local Full Stack Application using C#\nprogramming language on Visual Studio\xe2\x80\x99s Windows Forms App. Other tasks I had were to make\na documentation explaining how to access specific information on the website, so that when\nsenior engineers are absent for any reason, interns for example can have a guide to show them\ndetailed steps of how to use the website.\nDuring this Internship I feel like I have developed a lot of skills including problem solving,\npunctuality,Teamwork and also I learned how to use my technical skills and my knowledge from\nthe University courses with the job. The internship honestly did meet my expectations and I think\nit will have a huge influence on my career and my future because I feel like I won\xe2\x80\x99t need much\ntime to adapt to the environment of a head office or even adapt to the job itself, i\xe2\x80\x99ve already\nworked on a real existing database and worked on a real local application which are perfectly\ncorrelated with my field of study ( Computer Science and Computer Engineering ). The CSEN\n501 Databases course, The CSEN 202 programming course and the The CSEN 301 Data\nStructures and Algorithms course were the courses I found extremely beneficial during the\nInternship and allowed me to easily complete the given tasks.\nTo sum up, the key conclusions derived from the internship experience was that the tasks in the\ndevelopment industry are extremely similar to some of the assignments and  projects we work on\nin the university, so I guess it was extremely important for me to witness this by myself. I also\nfind that this Internship is really beneficial for anyone who is willing to try out how the\ndevelopment field actually works. My general observations about the sector in which my\ninternship company operates is that they are really thriving and operating on a spectacular\nprofessional level in all sectors and all departments. What I witnessed at the application team in\nthe Information Technology department was something exceptional and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I had this\n\x0copportunity. I\xe2\x80\x99m very satisfied with the Internship experience and I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend this Internship\nto other colleagues.\n.\n\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0c'
