b'\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0c \nInternship Report \nEmotion Recognition From Egyptian Speech \nWithout a doubt, datasets are vital in our world as they are fundamental to foster the \ndevelopment of several computational fields, giving scope, robustness, and confidence to results \nand data is the key component of any Machine Learning project. I am interested to talk about the \ninternship which is \xe2\x80\x9cEgyptian Arabic emotion speech dataset\xe2\x80\x9d at the GUC where the aim is to \ncreate and analyze an emotional speech dataset from well-known Egyptian Arabic movies or series \nfor a Machine Learning project. The dataset contained the following emotions: happy, sad, angry, \nneutral, surprised and fearful. Audio files were recorded using Audacity software in wav format \nthen programming tasks and simple audio preprocessing techniques were applied like denoising. I \nam going to summarize my internship experience by covering the company description, the \nperformed tasks, the evaluation and the conclusion. \nThe German University in Cairo, GUC, is an Egyptian Private University founded by the \npresidential decree 27/2002. The university has been established in 2002 in cooperation with the \nState Universities of Ulm and Stuttgart, under the patronage of the Egyptian Ministry of Higher \nEducation, the Ministry of Science, Research and Arts, State of Baden- W\xc3\xbcrttemberg, Germany, \nand supported by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), the German Embassy in \nCairo, the Arab/German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (AHK), the Federal Ministry of \nEducation and Research, Germany, The State University of T\xc3\xbcbingen, The State University of \nMannheim and the Academy of Fine Arts Leipzig. It is an independent, non-profit oriented \nEgyptian private institution, managed by a consortium of Germans and Egyptians with the vision \nof building a leading center of excellence in teaching and research that will effectively contribute \nto the general welfare nationally and internationally and endeavour the scientific, technical, \neconomic and cultural cooperation between Egypt and Germany. GUC went for a further step in \nquality enhancement by being accredited by ACQUIN. \n \n\x0c \nIn the internship we were divided into team of 4 members. We were given 3 Arabic series \nto watch and an assigned task was to collect data of 500 records each of us with balancing the \nfollowing emotions: happy, sad, angry, neutral, surprised and fearful by recording 20 records using \n\xe2\x80\x98Audacity software\xe2\x80\x99 per day for 5 days a week within the whole internship duration so basically \neach one of us took about 5 episodes per week, the remaining episodes of the series were divided \nbetween us the week after. After I recorded 20 records per episode in the day, I filled data in the \ngoogle spreadsheet which requires (Audio File Name, SpeakerID, Gender, Age Group, Main \nLabel, Series Name, Main Labeler, Speech Class \xe2\x80\x98Social/Politics/Scientific\xe2\x80\x99, 2nd Label, 3rd Label, \n4th Label, 2nd Labeler, 3rd Labeler, 4th Labeler). After finishing the 20 recordings with the \nnaming convention which was (Actor/Actress name_emotion_number) and filling the data in the \nspreadsheet, I upload my records to the corresponding actor/actress folder in the google drive so \nthey can listen and label my audios and I label the audios of my teammates as well so per day I \nrecord 20 audios and label minimum 60 audios of my teammates. I had programming tasks to \nimplement a voting system using python language to run the program through the google \nspreadsheet of which emotion wins for each audio so every audio has 4 votes the main label and \nthe other 3 labeling and the emotion which has the highest vote the program renames the \xe2\x80\x98Main \nLabel\xe2\x80\x99 column with the winning emotion and there is a draw column created if there is a draw it \nwill fill \xe2\x80\x98draw\xe2\x80\x99 in this column to the corresponding audio. I implemented a program which is \nstatistics for the spreadsheet on how many emotions recorded for each one of the 6 emotions and \nstatistics on the gender and creates a text file showing these statistics, I used \xe2\x80\x98Google colab\xe2\x80\x99 to \ncode in python for the programming tasks. Then I recorded 20 audios and labeled minimum 60 \naudios per day for the other 2 series as well so at the end I recorded about 500 audios and labeled \nabout 1500 audios; Moreover, I implemented background noise removal and silent removal \n\x0c \nprograms with python using google colab so I run them through the audios which denoise and \nremoves the silence in them. Here is an overview about some of the work I have done: \n \n\x0c \n \nThere are some skills I think I have gained like how to search and self-study effectively, \ngot better view at analyzing data and for sure learned new things in python like new libraries and \nfunctions I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about.  \nThe internship met my expectations definitely, the overview of the internship was clear \nenough before we start.  \n The internship will influence my future plans in discovering more about datasets and \nmachine learning. \nThe internship is related to my field because it includes programming tasks with python \nlanguage and data analysis as well.  \nThe possible related courses to this internship were Introduction to Computer Science \n(CS1) was introduction to python and Signals in the Signals Labs where I used python too, there \nwere audios sampling in Signals somehow related. \n \n \n \n \n\x0c \nTo sum up, I had really good experience throughout the internship. I learned new skills, it \nwas nice that we worked in teams for analyzing our dataset and the individual programming tasks \nhelped me learn more about python. I tried my best to learn and get the highest outcome possible \nof the internship and it broadened my horizon for the data analysis and machine learning career so \nI am interested now more in these fields and this will help me search and observe more for the \ndifferent Computer Science Engineering careers out there. We had a meeting with prof. \nMohammed Abdel-Megeed Salem and we have been told that our team had very good statistics in \nthe machine learning algorithm. I would like to say that I am very satisfied with the internship \nexperience and I would recommend this internship to my colleagues. \nReferences: German University in Cairo - About GUC \n \n'
