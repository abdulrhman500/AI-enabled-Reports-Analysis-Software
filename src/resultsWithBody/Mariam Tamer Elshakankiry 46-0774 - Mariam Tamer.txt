b'\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0cThis report covers the internship I conducted during the end of my bachelor semester, and \nthe start of my summer vacation. The company I interned at is \xe2\x80\x98Coberg\xe2\x80\x99, and it is a start-up in \nEgypt, but it has several world-wide branches, namely in England, Poland, United Arab \nEmirates, Saudi-Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait. Coberg\xe2\x80\x99s core values are actually reflected in its \nname, where C stands for \xe2\x80\x98Commitment\xe2\x80\x99, O for \xe2\x80\x98Openness\xe2\x80\x99, B for \xe2\x80\x98Bold & Passionate\xe2\x80\x99, E for \n\xe2\x80\x98Excellence\xe2\x80\x99, R for \xe2\x80\x98Respect & Empathy\xe2\x80\x99, and G for \xe2\x80\x98Growth\xe2\x80\x99. Coberg focuses on aiming its data \nand processes in the direction of a global technology consulting firm, and their main core \nrevolves around making customers\xe2\x80\x99 lives easier through CRM approaches, and hence they work \nwith their clients to understand the bottlenecks of data and processes, all while applying \ntechnology and related industry use cases to be solved. \nCoberg is an active partner of Salesforce, and so we used this cloud-based application\xe2\x80\x99s \nfeatures in applying the CRM\xe2\x80\x99s software. We also made use of Coberg\xe2\x80\x99s partnership with Slack, \nMuleSoft, Tableau Analytics, and Trailhead throughout our entire work. So, to categorize the \nworkflow, here are the details of how each software was utilized. Salesforce was the core of the \nentire internship; it was where I spent most of my time and effort. By integrating my pre-existing \nJava-script, HTML, and CSS knowledge with Salesforce\xe2\x80\x99s Lightning Web Components \nframework, I was able to create customized applications for the clients. I also used libraries such \nas the \xe2\x80\x98jspdf\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98autotable\xe2\x80\x99 libraries as well in order to have the client\xe2\x80\x99s required data \nformulated into a downloadable, tailored PDF document, all with a simple click of a button. In \norder for us to be able to use SaaS (Software as a Service) apps on top of Salesforce, we used \nApex\xe2\x80\x99 API services. With the help of Apex, we were able to access the Salesforce platform back-\nend database, alongside the client-server interfaces, all to create third-party SaaS applications, \nwithout going through the standard troublesome infrastructure that is traditionally associated \nwith SaaS programs. Luckily, Apex was a bit similar to SQL programs, thus I didn\xe2\x80\x99t face much \ntrouble when using it in the internship.  \nThe workspace provided when using Salesforce can be divided into two general \ncomponents: a playground/sandbox environment, and a production environment. From its name, \nthe sandbox is where we initially test out our code, and so all our ideas are poured there, even if \nthey are redundant or hectic. After all is done and tested, we move our work from the sandbox to \nthe production, which is where the final product we present to our clients is organized and \n\x0ccleaned up. Let me talk a little more about the testing process, since it was not that simple of a \nphase. For us to be able to deploy our code from the sandbox to the production, we must have \nunit tests that pass at least a 75% overall coverage for all our Apex classes. Tests are written in \nSalesforce\xe2\x80\x99s integrated developer console environment, which can be accessed through \nSalesforce\xe2\x80\x99s org, and is often used for creating, debugging, and testing our Salesforce \napplications. The nice thing about these tests, though, is that they ensure that most of our lines of \ncode are behaving the way they should, by inserting dummy data into our sandbox and testing \nour codes, given the required outputs we specify, and this data is created for the sole purpose of \ntesting and thus it is not stored in the org, and is automatically removed the moment we\xe2\x80\x99re done \ntesting. After all our Apex classes are given test classes that pass the 75% overall coverage, our \ncodes are ready to be deployed to Salesforce\xe2\x80\x99s production environment. \nAs for Slack, we mainly used it to connect and communicate with some of our clients\xe2\x80\x99 \ndevelopers, as well as for commuting within our own internal development team. MuleSoft was \nused to ease the API integration across the software, while Tableau was utilized to help us \nvisualize our data. I only scraped the surface of those two during my internship period, and so I \ndon\xe2\x80\x99t really have much to say about them as I do with Salesforce. Finally, we\xe2\x80\x99d keep going back \nand forth into Trailhead whenever there was a certain Salesforce concept that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t understood, \nor that needed further background knowledge before we can implement it into our code. It was \nused as a mini-crash course reference that we went to before delving into new ideas to implement \ninto our code. This wraps up the general workflow that I went through during my internship \nperiod. \nA typical working day in Coberg included our arrival in the office at 9 am, and departure \nat around 5 pm, though sometimes we\xe2\x80\x99d spend longer hours in the office trying to debug our \ncode or add the finishing touches before the next day\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the client. Despite the long \nstays at the office, I greatly enjoyed the time I spent in Coberg, seeing as it offers a very warm \nand friendly work-environment. As a matter of fact, Coberg was certified as \xe2\x80\x98a Great Place to \nWork\xe2\x80\x99 in the Middle East and on the 2nd of June, Coberg ranked the 7th of the \xe2\x80\x982021 Best \nWorkplaces in the Technology\xe2\x80\x99. The company has definitely earned such titles given the fact that \nit prioritizes employees\xe2\x80\x99 needs and wellbeing, by offering us a kitchen full of all kinds of \nnutritious foods and beverages, as well as ensuring to hire only the best-spirited employees that \n\x0caim at further tightening the bond between all of Coberg\xe2\x80\x99s employees through various team \nbuilding activities and events such as movie nights, dish parties, and playing \nPaddle/Squash/Tennis matches. We\xe2\x80\x99d also have weekly meetings every Sunday that start with \nthe employees sharing their happy moments that they experienced the previous week, whether it \nwas personal or work-related, then we\xe2\x80\x99d talk about the work that needed to be done by the end of \nthe week, and then at the very end, every employee would rate the amount of workload they \nwere given, where red indicated that the workload was too much, and green indicated \nsatisfaction. Any employee that gives a red rating would have another employee from the same \nposition share this workload and help them out, or would discuss with their supervisor how this \nworkload can be divided or organized in the best way possible to reduce the amount of stress put \non the employee.  \nIt is safe to say that I have gain a myriad of both soft and technical skills out of my \nparticipation in this internship. Regarding soft skills, I learned how to properly present myself \nand my work to clients, and how to give them an overview of what they\xe2\x80\x99d want to see from my \nwork, without going into the boring technical details that they may not necessarily comprehend. \nThis has helped me gain a lot of confidence in my work, and it improved my communication \nskills drastically. I also learned how to properly manage my time, given the fact that I had to \nbalance my internship with my bachelor project at some point. In addition, the exposure to an \nactual working environment that gives a monthly salary helped me gain a sense of responsibility \nand commitment, which I believe are essential to have when working in any company. \nRegarding the technical competences, my debugging skills improved radically during my stay in \nCoberg, as well as my familiarity with Salesforce\xe2\x80\x99s framework and environments. Data \nStructures and Algorithms, Databases I and II, Semester 7\xe2\x80\x99s ACL, and Analysis and Design of \nAlgorithms are all examples of the courses I took in GUC that were related to my internship; and \nthe knowledge that I gained out of them aided me throughout my internship journey. I also used \na lot of the Design Principles that were discussed in the Software Engineering course when it \ncame to designing the Salesforce org for the clients. Hence, this internship has definitely met my \nexpectations, and has even greatly exceeded them, and I recommend this internship to all GUC \nMET students.  \n\x0cTo wrap up, the experience I gained from this internship was incredibly beneficial, and it \nhas helped be grow individually as a person, and it broadened my insights on how the workplace \nenvironments generally behave, and I believe this will help me in the future when I take on a job \nposition that I can get promoted in. It gave me a taste of working in a team that shares a common \ngoal to overcome challenges and benefit the company, as well as overseeing my time and \ndeciding to spend it wisely so as not to fall behind neither in university, nor in the company. I \nlargely appreciate how Coberg prioritizes its employees and acknowledges their efforts, as I \nbelieve that the most important asset of any company is its employees. So long as the employees \nare satisfied and comfortable with the work environment, their results are sure to help flourish \nthe company, and Coberg is well aware of that and handles this perfectly, which is the top reason \nwhy I respect this company and recommend it to all of my colleagues.  \n \nReferences: https://coberg.net/our-locations/  \n \n        https://coberg.net/about/our-values/ \n                    https://coberg.net/insights/  \n \n\x0c \n'
