The internship was in the software \ndevelopment department, specifically the web development department in two different teams, back-end and \nfront-end. The internship objective is to learn how to make and maintain websites. The report starts with an \noverview about OTT Smart Vision, then the tasks and the responsibilities I had there and skills I gained. After \nthat I evaluated my internship and finally a summary of key conclusions derived from the internship experience. \n \nOverview of OTT Smart Vision: \n \nOTT Smart Vision was established in 2015. OTT Smart Vision is a Software House and its aim is to give the \ncustomers a smart service and simple solutions. OSV create meaningful solutions that inspire in telecom \nbusiness. Analytics and Assurance delivers a holistic approach to understanding how networks and devices are \nperforming, and what customers think about their experience. Also OSV provides real-time analysis, where big \ndata analytics offerings leverage user events, detailed location information, integrating OSS/BSS for real \ntransformation services, and other integrations to provide actionable insights that guide both customer-facing \nand network. \n \nActivities: \n \nI took my internship in the software development department with a team of programmers. The team objective \nis to make and maintain websites. The department were in charge of a site\xe2\x80\x99s overall look and feel, and handle \nthe technical aspects of a website, including its performance and capacity. The software development \ndepartment is divided into teams of developers. Specialized web developers are usually categorized as back-end \ndevelopers, front-end developers, full-stack developers and webmasters. I took my internship in two teams the \nback-end and front-end. In the back-end department I took tasks that handles a website\xe2\x80\x99s technical and \nconstruction aspects for the already created websites. Also I made some of the new website\xe2\x80\x99s basic framework \nand ensure it functions properly. While in the front-end department, we were responsible for a website\xe2\x80\x99s \nappearance. I made some of the website\xe2\x80\x99s layout and integrate applications, graphics, and other content. I \ncreated cascading style sheets (CSS) that are consistent across all browsers and platforms. I took part of the \nweekly meeting of the software development department, and took part of meetings with clients discussing their \nrequirements. I also created quality mockups and prototypes on tight timelines for clients and discuss it with \nthem before the implementing process. \n \nEvaluation: \n \nFirst of all I think this internship enhanced my social skills, I became more able to talk to new people, \ncommunicate with them. The internship for sure enhanced my skills in the web development department. . This \ninternship satisfied me greatly, as now I know how the big websites are created, updated and maintained, also it \nwas my first time to see and deal with live websites with active domain and server. This internship has been a \npractical and real perspective of the course "Advanced Computer Lab", as I used the same technologies learnt in \nthis course. I loved the work flow in both teams, but I loved the tasks assigned to me in the front-end team \nmore. This internship would help in my studies and my entire career as I learnt and practiced technical solutions \n\x0c   \n \n   \n6 \nStudent Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt \nand new technologies. Due to my high satisfaction with the company, for sure I will suggest it to my friends and \ncolleagues. \n \nTo Conclude: \n \nSoftware Development is a huge and highly important department, no way a company can start and keep going \nwithout creating and maintain a website, or having a mobile application, all of this takes time and effort, but at \nthe end it is really interesting. OSV\xe2\x80\x99s service sector does not need physical skills, however, it needs technical \nand interpersonal skills, employees in the maintenance department need to have passion to listen, communicate \nand solve the technical problems for the customers to satisfy them and provide good reputation and image for \nthe company they work in. OSV is keen to have a good maintenance and technical support team who can deal \nwith really big problems that could occur in this field and deal with angry customers to provide them solutions \nand compensations whenever needed.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0c   \n \n   \n7 \nStudent Career & Alumni Development O\xef\xac\x83ce. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt \n \n \n \n \nReferences: \n \nhttp://osmartvision.com/ \n \n \n'
