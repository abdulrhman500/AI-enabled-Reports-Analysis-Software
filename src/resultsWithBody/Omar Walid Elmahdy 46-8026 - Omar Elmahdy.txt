Since its establishment in 2002, ADES has grown to \nbecome Egypt's largest offshore drilling operator by number of rigs, with a growing \npresence in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Algeria and ongoing penetration \ninto new MENA markets. \nDuring my time at ADES, I worked on multiple projects that had different requirements \nand tasks. The tasks were mainly software development, some were web development, \ndepending on the project. I arrive at 9:00 at the company\xe2\x80\x99s HQ in Zayed, and begin \ndiscussing with my supervisor the daily tasks and urgent requirements that I could help \nwith during the day after setting everything up. One day there was an upgrade happening \nto the data center which I followed and learned how everything worked in there. I worked \ndirectly and was supervised by the company\xe2\x80\x99s system admin Fady Emad. Also, for the \nfirst month I worked with another IT intern in a couple of the projects. Mainly I used my \nlaptop in everything using a couple of softwares. Softwares such as, MS Sharepoint and \nMS Power Automate that I used to do some web development, Oracle APEX that I used \nto fully build a database that tracked IT assets and managed them in an organized \nmanner. There was also MobaXterm that managed the server and the Virtual machine. \nThese are the main programs. I did a lot of research to be able to work with the all the \nnew softwares that I never used before. And a lot of research to trouble shoot issues that I \nfaced throughout the projects.  \n \n \n\x0c \nIn the internship, I gained new skills and developed old skills that I already had. I learned \nto how in a hierarchal manner which meant that I needed to constantly report to my \nsupervisor. I developed my team working and people skills. I learned how to work and \nadapt to new softwares and rapidly learn from my environment. In the future I will be \nable to make more informed decisions concerning my career based on what I have \nexperienced in the work field. \n \n"
