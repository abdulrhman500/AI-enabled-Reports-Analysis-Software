b"This internship was at EGID (Egypt for Information Dissemination) in Cairo, Egypt. The \ninternship had three main purposes. One purpose was to teach interns more about object-\noriented programming and how it can be used in real life professional projects. Another \npurpose was teaching and using java\xe2\x80\x99s framework spring boot to build micro services and a \nconnection to SQL databases which would later serve as the backend for the tasks. The third \npurpose was to introduce us to the basics of frontend development through learning html and \nCSS. The project's tasks were implementing multiple web pages and their backend APIs. \nThese Web pages were part of a bigger web application used by another company to. \nEGID is a joint venture between the Egyptian Exchange (EGX) and NASDAQ, has over 20 \nyears of experience acting as a credible, authorized information source for EGX-listed \ncompanies. The information the company provide helps Egypt-based as well as international \ninvestors get a better understanding of Egyptian financial markets. Moreover, EGID also \nplans to soon take the software development market by storm with various technology \nsolutions that could be used by many sectors. Furthermore, our Tier 3 data center and hosting \nsolutions are built to cater to investors\xe2\x80\x99 every need and be compatible with the highest levels \nof required security, especially for the financial sectors. \n \nThe internship was divided into two parts .In the first part we learned about the technologies \nwe were going to use in the big project  accompanied by mini tasks and projects to ensure \nthat we were on the right track for example in one of the tasks we were asked to make a crud \nwebsite for stocks using html and CSS and make it functional using spring boot and SQL as \nthe backend .However in the second part we joined on one  of the ongoing projects we were \ntasked with building some of the APIs used in the project and testing them using trial web \npages that we built . \nThis internship has highly exceeded my expectations I have gained new knowledge and \nexperience about multiple career I can pursue once I graduate also, I refined my basics on \nobject-oriented programming and learned new algorithms that can be used to enhance my \nproject\xe2\x80\x99s performance. Other than the new technologies I learned the importance of time \nmanagement in managing deadlines and the importance of communication within the team to \navoid major problems down the line. The courses that helped me the most during this \ninternship was CSEN2 introduction to computer programming using java and CSEN3 data \nstructures and algorithms. \nTo sum up everything that has been stated so far, I have received an enormous amount of \nknowledge and experience from this internship at EGID. A rewarding experience was \nlearning more about web development and full stack projects in general. Furthermore, I \nmanaged to improve my teamwork and time management skills and became more \naccustomed to working in teams over the course of the internship. This internship has opened \nmy eyes on to the many career paths that I can take in the future as a computer science \nengineer and has generally inspired me and made me excited for the future ahead. \n \n\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0c"
