In Savola you will not only be benefiting from a technical point of view, but also \nfrom a businesswise perspective you will get huge experience working there. In this report I will \nbe discussing what is Savola and what the expectations from working there are. The main \nobjective of this internship was to have a first-hand experience on how major industries\xe2\x80\x99 \ndatabases and systems are ran, maintained, and upgraded also what is it like to have a peak of \nhow it\xe2\x80\x99s like to actually getting assigned a task from the perspective of a MET student. \nSavola is a multinational food company that makes consumer products such as cooking oil, ghee, \nsugar and many other products. The main headquarters are located in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. \nSavola is also present in many countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Sudan, Algeria, \nMorocco and many other countries. Under Savola there are brands that are under Savola Group. \nHaving an internship at Savola for MET students comes with many benefits, such as getting a \nclose look on how a company such as Savola can handle the databases of clients and the other \nbrands its covering. As well as how the databases are actually upgraded and maintained.  \nDuring my internship period I was assigned a variety of tasks. Such as I was assigned to \nSalesbuzz the company\xe2\x80\x99s main interface that is used to issue and track all orders and products \nthat get in or out the company\xe2\x80\x99s processing facilities. I was assigned to test the testing server and \nthe production server after I was given sufficient training with the old servers. So I had the task to \ntest the upgraded servers after the upgrade was made to confirm that there are no bugs and issues \nfrom the upgrade. I was also trained to use Power BI an application to display data. I was also \ngiven a certified training course by the company to be able to use the application.  \nThe Internship at Savola came with many positive aspects such as the ability to work under stress \nand this is a skill that I believe is very essential in any future job. Also being at Savola during my \ninternship period, I found many similarities in some subjects and courses I took at the GUC in the \nprevious years, such as Databases 1 and 2, and there was a bit of the Networks course that I found \nvery useful as well. During the internship period, I used SQL as I was introduced to the \ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s databases and servers. I was also given a brief introduction on how to use Oracle to \nmaintain and navigate through databases. \nFinally, I would like to mention that Savola is a company that mainly focuses on the industrial \nsector, however it needs a very significant technical support to back up the progress. On a local \nlevel Savola dominates most markets such as the oil sector and the sugar sector with brands such \nas Afia for Oil and Al-Osra for sugar. Concerning the technical side, Savola has the latest \ntechnologies for employee and client support. Being part of the IT team you will have to have \nsome basic information about almost every sector of the company as you as an IT support your \nmain job is to be able to support all sectors of the company. \n'
