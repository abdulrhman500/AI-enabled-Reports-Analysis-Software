b' \n\x0c \n\x0c \n\x0c \n\x0cThis summer I got the chance to work as a part of the research and development team in ITWorx as an \nintern. This opportunity made me extremely excited since I have always wanted to work in such a firm \non such a scale in the research and development sector since they are usually spearheading \ntechnologies and solutions that would be common place later on. My main concern was finding the \noptimum graph data base solution for a specific client that they had and, in this report, I will go over the \nspecific tasks I had and the technologies that I used in addition to proving a brief description of the \ncompany and my evaluation of the experience as a whole. \nITWorx is a full-service, global technology provider with five offices worldwide in Cairo, California, \nConnecticut, Zug, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi that partners with the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading governments and \norganizations throughout their digital journeys. They have helped their clients personalize and \nstreamline their user interactions into a higher quality, more insightful, and more productive experience \nfor their customers, partners, employees, and management teams alike. Their employees and their well-\nbeing are always at the heart of Their operations, and they believe that creating respectful and inclusive \nworkplaces founded on these values is what guides Their mission to build technologies that make \npeople happier.  \nI was a part of ITWorx research and development team as an intern for two months. My main task was \ntesting different graph databases and frameworks for a client in order to find one that fits their exact \nneeds. First, I learned about the tests carried out by the team before I came using Neo4J and replicated \nthem, then I began to explore other options starting with Amazon Web Service\xe2\x80\x99s Neptune, after gaining \nsome experience with it I reformatted the data and redid all the tests done in Neo4J and compared the \nresults.After that I did the same tests with three other frameworks which are Oracle, TigerGraph and \nArangoDB. Then after reading each of these services\xe2\x80\x99 documentation extensively I prepared a document \nto compare all their features including performance, pricing, technical features and support. \n \nThroughout the internship I learned to use a wide range of technologies that I had never used before. \nFirst, I learned about Neo4J and OpenCypher which are what the team was working on before I came in \norder to familiarize myself with the concept of graph databases and cloud computing, Then inn order to \nreplicate the tests done in Neo4J I had to get familiar with many technologies in the Amazon Web \nServices framework such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Simple Storage Service, AWS \nIdentity and Access Management and many more including of course Neptune and gremlin. After that I \nlearned GSQL in order to use TigerGraph and also gained some experience using Docker and virtual \nmachines in order to run it on Windows. Afterwards, I got familiar with Oracle Cloud Computing and \nPGQL in order to do the same tests and finally I learned how to use ArangoDB and AQL. In addition to all \nof this, in order to write my final comparison document, I had to learn a lot about the technical aspects \nof databases and cloud computing so as to make my comparison as concise as possible. It is safe to say \nthat this internship did meet and exceed my expectations since I got to learn so much and got a taste of \nthe professional work environment especially since it correlated heavily with my studies and especially \nthe two databases courses that I took, graph databases were even first introduced to me in CSEN604 \n(Databases II) which made my first few days much easier. This internship also made me interested to \nwork in research and development after graduating which is something that I always thought about but \ndid not get to try until now. \n\x0cTo conclude, I truly believe that this internship was immensely useful for me and my career both \npractically and academically and also by increasing my employment prospects as it made me more \nfamiliar with graph databases and its many uses in the industry and cloud computing which will open up \nmore career opportunities for me in the future since more and more employers require or need these \nskills. I was extremely satisfied with my internship experience and would definitely recommend an \ninternship at ITWorx for any student who is interested in an internship about data engineering or \ncomputer science in general. \n \n'
