b"\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0cInternship Report\nThe report\xe2\x80\x99s main aim is to clarify and state all the aspects of the internship program i have\njoined in SeoEra Company. I will be mainly discussing what i have learned, what tools or\nlanguages i used, what were the most useful outcomes of this internship program, and some\nother details concerning the working day. I have done an internship before this one in which\nit was all about databases, how to deal with records, extract records and other tasks using sql\nquery. That is why my main aim when searching for an internship this summer was to join a\nprogram that is different, specifically related to either web development or mobile\napplications development.Web development is one of the most important and interesting jobs\nin the field of computer science for me, because through it businesses could easily make\npeople aware of products or services they offer. Additionally, nowadays website quality is\nused to rate the businesses, moreover, web developers are really needed everywhere, in\naddition to their high salaries. That is why i was interested in enhancing my skills in web\ndevelopment through joining this internship program in SeoEra, especially because i have\nseen that they have worked with so many well known institutions. In this report i will be\ndiscussing different aspects that will be ordered as follows: First of all, a description about\nthe company itself. Next, the tasks i have performed, what i have learned and the nature of\nthe working day. Then my evaluation to this internship program. Finally a conclusion about\nthe whole experience.\nSeoEra is an Egyptian web development agency that already has more than 12 years\nexperience in web design and development. They do not only offer web design and\ndevelopment but they also have more services like SEO, mobile app development, social\nmedia services, and others. Having mentioned the services they offer, their vision is whitehat\nSEO that they are already using in their SEO plan so that their customers could get a first\npage ranking. SeoEra\xe2\x80\x99s mission is to architect and develop CMS that enables clients to easily\nmanage their websites. They have worked on projects with different companies and\ninstitutions such as Misr Travel, Memphis Tours, Invstoc, Trips4u and others. Their partners\nare National bank of Egypt, PayPal, arab african international bank, codeIgniter, and others.\nMore information can be known about SeoEra through this link which is their official website\nhttps://www.seoera.net .\nThis internship program was divided into many phases, in which i have performed different\ntasks or learned different aspects. Throughout the program, i have used visual studio code and\n\x0cPhpStorm for coding in parallel with Xampp[Apache and Mysql]. I have also used composer\nand github. The first week, which was the first phase of the internship, i was encouraged to\nwatch edx cs50 Harvard course to go through all the coding aspects and refresh what i have\nalready learned in the GUC, in addition to implementing whatever the tutor was explaining\nwhich were search problems, optimization problems and others. The second phase was the\nHackerRank phase in which i solved problems to acquire the problem solving basic level\ncertificate, then i spent a week just solving challenges which were different types of problems\nwith different difficulty levels using java. Then the most important phase of this program was\nlearning PHP that took many weeks of the internship period. I was first guided to watch the\ntraverse crash course 3+ hours for PHP beginners in which i was introduced to PHP basics,\nand how to define a piece of code that is to be written in PHP. Then my supervisor teached\nme more about PHP,  how it is different from other programming languages, and showed me\nsome code samples written for the company's work. Moreover, he introduced me to Xampp,\nwhich i installed after that. I searched for ways of setting it up, using it to create a database,\ncreating tables inside the database and adding entries to the table. Additionally, i searched for\nthe apache server to know more about it. After that i spent time searching for ways to connect\nto the database integrated in Xampp[Mysql] using PHP, after several times i was able to\nconnect to a demo database and manipulate it using a small piece of code just for trial. After\nthat my supervisor instructed me to start on my first project which was a ToDo list using php\nthat was a CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) exercise, which was kind of challenging and\ntook several days as i had to do a lot of individual search to get started and use PHP for the\nfirst time ever. The task included adding a task to the database with its description, editing a\ntask already existing in the database, deleting a task, and finally viewing all the entries in the\ndatabase. After finishing the ToDo list, i was guided to search for object oriented\nprogramming (OOP) in PHP and watch videos to know how to deal with OOP in PHP. When\ni finished learning about OOP in PHP i re-implemented the ToDo list using OOP, then i\nimplemented a Mini basic school functionalities website which was also a CRUD exercise\nthat adds students to the database by adding their names, age, gpa, department. It also\nincluded deleting a student from the database, editing a student record and viewing the whole\ndatabase using HTML, and Bootstrap. Then i was encouraged  to start working on a website\nfor food ordering using PHP, HTML, and CSS. It is basically a website that has admins who\ncontrol the website, add food, delete food, add a category of food, and others, in addition to,\nusers who could purchase food after filling up a form with their information as the name,\naddress, mobile number, and payment method. I spent many days working on it but\n\x0cunfortunately there was not enough time to spend completing it in order to proceed with the\nlast phase. The last phase was the Laravel framework in which i did all the work on the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s computer due to some issues with my laptop that did not enable me to use laravel.\nIn this phase my supervisor personally teached me what laravel is, why it is used, and what\ndiffers when using it. Then i watched a laravel course for beginners and did more search to\nlearn more about laravel. After several videos i re-did the todo list using laravel, and a student\nmanagement system task also using laravel that is for student use to view their schedules,\ngrades, courses, attendance, in addition to, reporting problems regarding doctors of their\nenrolled courses. Apart from the tasks and what i have learned, i have had so much fun and\ncomfort on the working day. They were so friendly, very helpful and were always motivating.\nAdditionally, we always had a break from 1pm to 2 pm where we always gathered, talked\nwith the CEO, played card games and shared life experiences together.\nInternships are crucial for all students because it enhances their skills and allow them to\nacquire more knowledge in their field by learning from people who have been in the field for\nyears. I personally have gained a bunch of skills after joining this internship, i became more\nconfident, friendly, a lot more active, and less shy. I have also gained more problem solving\nskills by being encouraged to try again or search again instead of being given the solution of\na problem directly which resulted in me being more patient. Furthermore, my debugging and\nsearching skills were enhanced because i was always guided to find why a specific thing was\nnot working by debugging and then searching for the solution and trying whether it would\nwork out with my case or not. In addition to skills that could be gained from any internship\nwhich are managing my time, the team i have worked with were perfect at managing their\ntime in which i acquired this skill from them. They were also so responsible and always on\ntime, they added my fingerprint to their system and i was always encouraged to be on time to\nenter my fingerprint as this is how working conditions will be. The internship did meet my\nexpectations and even exceeded to the extent that i think i will be changing my plans after\ngraduation to work in the field of web development instead of databases careers. Correlating\nthe program with what i have studied in the GUC, it is similar to every course related to\ncomputer science we studied as we always learn a new programming language and then apply\nit practically in a project. The program is directly related to what we have done in Advanced\nComputer lab (ACL) which was developing a website for a flight agency. However, in this\ninternship i used PHP, Laravel, CSS, and HTML which are not what we used in the ACL\n\x0ccourse. After this wonderful experience,  i would for sure recommend this internship to other\ncandidates.\nTo conclude, i have really enjoyed every day of this internship program. It was more than\nperfect for me and an amazing experience. I have learned a lot from each and everyone in the\noffice, especially my supervisor. However, i should state that it would have been better if it\nwas more than two months so that i can master Laravel and get to do bulky projects. Before\nthis internship i did not have any experience with either PHP or Laravel, so by this time i am\nreally grateful for all the information i have learned concerning the language and the\nframework. Finally, i can say that SeoEra\xe2\x80\x99s are operating in a fast growing field which is web\ndevelopment and design. In addition to that, it is very competitive and in my opinion\neveryone in the company has to always work on himself and take courses in order to be able\nto be on the same level as other employees in the same field and save their jobs.\nAppendix\nThis section contains some shots of some of the work that i have done and have access to.\nHackerRank Certificate:\nTodo-list task photos:\n\x0c1- Viewing the entries in database\n2- Creating a new task\nMini-School task photos:\n1- Viewing the entries\n2- Editing the entries\n\x0c3- Adding a student entry\nFood ordering website:\n\x0c1- Login\n2- Viewing the admins\n"
