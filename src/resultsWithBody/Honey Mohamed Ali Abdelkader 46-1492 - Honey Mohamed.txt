It was a \ngame development intern position; I will be discussing what I learned during the internship as \nwell as the impact it had on me. \nPhantasm is a startup company that started in 2015 shaping systems for global \norganizations. They were focusing on software development until 2019 when they added their \ngame design department. Their goal is to utilize the gaming industry to empower education and \nbusiness. They work on gamifying contents and digitizing existing simulations and board games. \nThis could be clearly seen from their website https://www.phantasm.biz/ . \nDuring the internship program at Phantasm, I was in the game development team. I \napplied to this internship during the GUC job fair. The internship program consisted of creating a \nfull team of interns to develop a mobile game from scratch. My tasks would include writing c# \nscripts and working on the User Interface (UI) of the game. We were working using the agile \nmethod. Each week we had a meeting with the publisher to give us feedback about our work, \nafter that we would plan the tasks for the next sprint. Each sprint lasts for a week. Lastly, we \nwould track our progress in the daily standup meeting. The work was remote but we had a \nmeeting once per week in the office, to discuss our progress with the Phantasm team and the \nfeedback of the publisher. \nI was using Unity as the software for developing the game and Visual Studio for writing c# \nscripts. The scripts were all using object-oriented programming. The scripts were then applied to \nUnity game objects to define their behavior in the game. I was mainly working with the UI of the \ngame. I would create game objects that served as the menus of the game. Each menu consists of \ncards that would be instantiated based on the content of the menu. Cards are represented by \nclasses so that we can define and instantiate more content easily. \nI was familiar with Unity and writing c# scripts using Visual Studio as my bachelor project was \nVR game development using Unity. However, research was needed to broaden my skills in \nmobile development. Additionally, in the first weeks we would have meetings with Phantasm\xe2\x80\x99s \ndevelopment team to explain their workflow and their best practices so that the game would \napply to their standard.   \n\x0cBelow are several attached images showing a sample of the coding that was needed from me. It \ndepicts the class of the missions menu. Mission is a card that is represented by a class. The card \nis then instantiated to populate the mission menu. The script also checks the progress of the \nmission to give the user visual feedback and to update the needed values in the game. I was not \nable to attach the actual file or any of the remaining classes as part of Phantasm\xe2\x80\x99s Privacy Policy \nespecially since the game has not been launched yet. \n \n \n\x0c \n\x0c \nAmongst the skills I have gained from my internship experience, I can mention self-\nlearning, doing a lot of research to be able to solve any problem that would occur, or to be able to \nfind the right function to use when writing the code to present the most efficient results. I have \nalso enriched my c# skills and learned how to write scalable codes.  \n \n\x0cThe internship was really beneficial to me as it gave me a glimpse of the real working \nenvironment in a startup company office. As my previous internship was in an international \ncompany, I got to evaluate the pros and cons of working in each company. The internship \nprogram was organized in a way that allows everyone to get the maximum benefit. It was a little \ntough as working remotely allows for work to take more time than the daily working hours, but \nthat only gave me an extra opportunity to learn. It was also challenging to be taking over a full \nproject from scratch with minimal interference from the employed team. I was exposed to many \ndifferent stages of software development such as the brainstorming phase, pitching the idea to \nthe publisher, facing the challenges of creating the roadmap of the project, defining tasks for \neach sprint and being able to present the desired output to the publisher each week. \nThis internship helped me gain knowledge in the game development field that would make me \nmore confident in my skills whenever I apply to a post graduate job in this field.  \nThis internship was correlated with my studies as it mainly depended on writing codes \nand then using my problem-solving skills. These skills were already taught to me in my \nuniversity in my CSEN1 and CSEN2 courses where I learned the basics of writing scripts and the \nfundamentals of object-oriented programming. I was already familiar with Visual Studio as I \nused the software in databases courses before. I had also prior knowledge using Unity as this was \nthe software, I used for my bachelor project. This internship also allows me to better understand \nthe ACL course during the 9th semester. \nI would recommend this company as it gives the interns an opportunity not only to learn but also \nto practice what they learned in a real-life working environment. The supervisors have a well-\norganized learning plan and are always available to help and give advice. Being able to work on \na project from the very early stages definitely prepares the interns to be able to succeed in future \nsoftware engineering jobs.  \nAt last, I feel like this internship was successful for me.  I got to physically participate, go \nto an office, attend meetings and at the same time I got to know what it is like to work remotely. \nI have seen how to apply what I learned in real life circumstances. The tasks given to me helped \nme be more at ease with game development. I also learned how my supervisors would solve the \nproblems that the interns weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to. I met and networked with many new interesting people. \nI believe that I gained a huge bonus by getting to work in a startup company and got to be more \n\x0cinvolved in the project and to really communicate with their employees. Overall, it was a good \nexperience and it felt more than just an internship, I got to experience how it feels to belong to a \ncompany and to a team that has the same standards and work ethics as myself. \n \n'
