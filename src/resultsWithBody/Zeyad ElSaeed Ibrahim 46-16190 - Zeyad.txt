b"\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0cI worked for a company in Kafr ElSheikh governorate. The company satisfies a local\nneed for software solutions that facilitate daily operations. The company has only been on\nthe market for a few years, but aims to expand to serve customers in other regions outside\nthe prefecture. The company is active in the field of software development, especially in\nfinance related to inventory. We are developing an application for local shops,\nrestaurants, and hospitals to manage their inventory of goods, medicines, and more. It\nhelps us know what we have in stock, what orders are coming in, and when we need to\norder more.\nI was an intern at the company with another one at the time, and as far as I can remember,\nit was a normal work day with no new events. My day starts from 10am to 4pm. There\nare several breaks during this period. The staff I worked with in the same office were\nfriendly and helpful during my internship.\nI have been assigned to some tasks, such as creating a small inventory database and\nrunning the queries you created. In addition to creating a graphical user interface to\nhandle all this. I was using SQL Server Management 2008 to create the database and its\nqueries. In addition to Visual Studio 2013, use the C# programming language to edit\ndatabases and create application interfaces. I used Teleirk Reporting, an embedded tool in\nVisual Studio, to create reports based on the data in my database and export them to a\nlocal web page.  I encountered many obstacles during my internship and was encouraged\nto search the internet for solutions before seeking advice from my supervisor. All my\nwork was done on a company PC, and I didn't back up any data from there due to\nconfidentiality.\nIn addition to using Visual Studio, SQL Server Management and Telerik Reporting, I\nhave broadened my knowledge of object-oriented programming. In addition to sales skills\nsuch as inventory management, purchasing, and receipt information, in the end, the\ninternship met my expectations after realizing how much knowledge I had learned. I\nstopped learning about business field because it's not my passion. Several academic\ncourses were associated with internships such as: Database I, Database II, CSEN401,\nSoftware Engineering. In conclusion, I would recommend this company due to the\nfriendly work atmosphere and small size.\nIn summary, it was a good month with lots of information and improvements to my\ncurrent skills. It was a good practice of what I studied at university. The company's\ndownside is that it uses outdated software versions that are not ready for upgrades. The\ndivision in which the company operates is growing as new facilities open. Also, the world\n\x0cis moving towards globalization and e-commerce. Inventory management becomes\nharder to balance over time. The company offers products at reasonable prices, which\nencourages locals to switch to simpler technology.\n"
