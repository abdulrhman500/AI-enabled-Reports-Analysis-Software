My main purpose of performing this \ninternship was to develop my skills in the frontend design field and to gain more experience in \nthe field which I\xe2\x80\x99m passionate about which is designing combined with my field of study which \nis Computer science engineering. In this internship I was responsible of designing an application \nfrom scratch after receiving the requirements sheet from the client. In this report I will go deeper \nin the internship details after a brief about the company and last but least a conclusion to sum up \nthe report.\nDigital creativity company or el-abda3 company is a leading company in the field of web \ndevelopment since 2005 and mobile app development since 2007. It headquarters is located in \nEgypt. The main industry of the company is information technology and services. The company \nprovide customer companies with high quality, cost effective, reliable services that include but \nnot limited to: Mobile application development, E-marketing mobile integration, mobile \napplications porting and cross platform, WAP and website development, web hosting, serves and \nlast but not least cloud servers. The company has more than 150 applications published on the \napple store and more than 90 applications on google play store.\nIn this internship I was a UI/UX designer, First I receive the user requirements sheet and \nstart reading it carefully to understand all what the client wants to be done in the application and \nto understand the type of the customers that will be using this application and try as much as I \ncan to make an application that is simple and elegant. After that I start creating the workflow \n(user flow) of the application using Visio workflow to organize the pages of the application and \nto organize the flow. After that I start the design process according to the approved workflow, I \nstart by choosing the appropriate color palette that will match the application and the target \nclient, and then design the application on Adobe XD according to the IOS design schema and \nusing native IOS components. The designs followed minimal design so it only depended on the \nfont weights and few colors so it is comfortable to the eye. Finally, I create a presentation for the \nclient to see an overview of the design until the frontend developers finish the coding process. In \nthe last week of the internship, I coded one of the pages as a coding training using HTML and \nCSS.\n\x0c  \n  \n6\nStudent Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al \nKhames; Egypt\nDuring the internship, we were a team of 4 girls working on the same projects. We \nusually arrived work at 9 and start working around 9:30. The normal working day always went \non smoothly, some days the obstacles we used to face was achieving the minimal design and \ncovering all the cases\xe2\x80\x99 pages (for example when logging in, there should be 3 pages, one shows \nthe plain design that the user will land on, one if the number used is wrong and one for the right \ninfo) as shown below:\nThis application is in Arabic as it was for a Saudi Arabian client which was challenging too as \nfinding correct Arabic words was not easy and it was challenging too to design that would be \nappropriate to fit in the Saudi Arabian culture due to several restrictions that they put on \ndesigning. Majority of the clients that the company deal with are Arabic clients (non-Egyptians) \nso we always had to be up to date to latest trends in each of these countries. Our mentor which is \nalso the CEO of the company was really helpful and always helped us through these challenges \nby transferring his experience to us and taught us how to think mainly and how to find solutions \nto the problems that we faced which increased my problem-solving skills and my ability to \nanalyze the problem to know in which area should I search. \n\x0c  \n  \n7\nStudent Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al \nKhames; Egypt\nWhen I began the internship, I worked using Figma as it was the software I\xe2\x80\x99m familiar with but \nafter that I started using Adobe XD as it had better interface and better features to work with and \nalso because that was the software that the company works with. I also used Visio to create the \nflow of the pages and all the possible paths that the user might take.\nI believe I gained several skills from this internship including but not limited to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nProblem-solving skills\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nOrganizational skills\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nDetail oriented\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nThe ability to work in a team\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nVisualization skills\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nFlexibility \n\xe2\x80\xa2\nThe ability to use Adobe XD perfectly (Advanced level)\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nResearching skills\nThe internship met my expectations as I learned to use new software (Adobe XD and Visio) and \nworked on a real project for a high-class client, and also as it helped work in a field that has both \ndesigning which is my passion and coding which is my study field. This internship actually will \ninfluence my future career as now I can either work as a UI/UX designing freelancer or a \ndesigner in another company. The academic courses that are most related to this internship are \n1. Software engineering CSEN 603\n2. Analysis and design of algorithms CSEN 703\n3. Introduction to IT project management HUMA 1001\n4. Human Computer interactions CSEN 909\nI highly recommend this company to other students due to the warm, friendly work environment \nand all the technical benefits that they will gain not only in the design department but in other \ndepartments too.\nIn conclusion, it was a very fruitful internship that helped me improve a lot of skills \neither technical or personal. The company has a very friendly atmosphere that encourages \neveryone working there to put all the effort they can in work without being stressed. The \ninternship was focused on IOS mobile applications design in which I worked on 5 tasks one of \n\x0c  \n  \n8\nStudent Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al \nKhames; Egypt\nthem was a real client\xe2\x80\x99s project. Since most of the clients where no Egyptians, I see that mobile \nsolutions field in Egypt should take more attention as it will help solve a lot of problems in any \nlife field.\n"
