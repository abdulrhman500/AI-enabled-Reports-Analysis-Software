b"\x0c\x0c\x0c\x0cThis internship was at EGID (Egypt for Information Dissemination) in Cairo, Egypt. The \ninternship had three main purposes. One purpose was to teach interns more about python and \nits framework flask and how to implement web sockets and sessions. Another purpose was \nteaching and using of angular the frontend technology with CSS bootstrap html and \ntypescript. The third purpose was to use our prior experiences in building two main projects.  \nThe project's tasks were implementing multiple web pages and their backend APIs. And to \nbuild an internal web app that can be used as a tool by other departments to automate their \nwork. \nEGID is a joint venture between the Egyptian Exchange (EGX) and NASDAQ, has over 20 \nyears of experience acting as a credible, authorized information source for EGX-listed \ncompanies. The information the company provide helps Egypt-based as well as international \ninvestors get a better understanding of Egyptian financial markets. Moreover, EGID also \nplans to soon take the software development market by storm with various technology \nsolutions that could be used by many sectors. Furthermore, our Tier 3 data center and hosting \nsolutions are built to cater to investors\xe2\x80\x99 every need and be compatible with the highest levels \nof required security, especially for the financial sectors. \n \nThe internship was divided into two parts .In the first part we learned about the technologies \nwe were going to use in the big projects  accompanied by mini tasks and projects to ensure \nthat we were on the right track for example in one of the tasks we were asked to make a crud \nlibrary website using Angular as the frontend technology which uses typescript html and \nbootstrap CSS and make it functional using python\xe2\x80\x99s framework flask and SQL as the \nbackend . in the second part I was responsible for building a crm (company\xe2\x80\x99s resource \nmanagement) storage system tool that was used by other departments to keep track of the \ncompanies\xe2\x80\x99 resources. \nThis internship has highly exceeded my expectations I have gained new knowledge and \nexperience about multiple career I can pursue once I graduate also, I refined my basics on \npython and learned new algorithms that can be used to enhance my project\xe2\x80\x99s performance. \nOther than the new technologies I learned the importance of time management in managing \ndeadlines and the great effect we can have on the other departments in automating their \nworkload. The courses that helped me the most during this internship was CSEN2 \n1introduction to computer programming using python and CSEN7 analysis and algorithms. \nTo sum up everything that has been stated so far, I have received an enormous amount of \nknowledge and experience from this internship at EGID. A rewarding experience was \nlearning more about web development and full stack projects in general. Furthermore, I \nmanaged to improve my teamwork and time management skills and became more \naccustomed to working in teams over the course of the internship. This internship has opened \nmy eyes on to the many career paths that I can take in the future as a computer science \nengineer and has generally inspired me and made me excited for the future ahead. \n \n"
