This report is prepared by me, Ahmed Atwan, at the request of the SCAD office at the German
University in Cairo, to highlight the key events and Gains from my Internship this Summer,
July-August 2022. The Internship was conducted in Link Development, Under the supervision of
Eng. Ahmed Mostafa and Eng. Doaa Magdy. The Internship worked under the topic of backend
development. I applied for this position to gain professional experience in the high-demand
domain of backend development. Moreover, I chose to intern at Link development as it is
acknowledged as one of the main leaders in providing technology solutions. The report consists
of three parts: Organization Description, tasks performed in the internship, and my evaluation of
the internship.
The internship took place in Link development's office in Cairo. Link development
(https://linkdevelopment.com/) is a global technology solutions provider leading the
digitalization of private and public sector organizations. Link was founded in 1996, and it
operates in more than 24 countries through offices in Egypt (headquarters), UAE, KSA, Italy,
and Qatar. Link Development aims to achieve a technical advantage for its customers by
providing digital strategy and roadmaps, building immersive, exciting customer experiences and
delivering sustainable business optimization solutions. I was assigned to work on the
AIPA(African Investment Promotion Agency) website project. The team consisted of the project
manager, Eng. Doaa Magdy, Technical lead, Ahmed Mostafa, and two senior developers from
each of the following domains: frontend, backend, and quality control. It was a hybrid internship
since we worked from both the office and home.
Initially, all interns were given a task to create a simple demo website for an electronics shop
using frameworks from our previous knowledge.  I used ASP.net webforms, Microsoft SQL
Server, and stored procedures. For the next four weeks, I was assigned to work on the
AIPA(African Investment Promotion Agency) website project team. In the first week, I was
given a task to revise software development basics like clean code, SOLID principles, and C#
fundamentals. A checkpoint meeting was held at the end of each day to discuss what was learned
and real code examples, followed by a brief on the following day’s topic. For the following two
weeks, I had a task to create a REST API using .NET Core, Entity Framework, and Repository
design pattern. This was followed by studying N- tiered architectures and transforming my API
to a 3-tiered project containing a data access layer, business logic layer, and data presentation
layer.  After each milestone,  a meeting was held with the technical lead where I presented a
demo for the latest features updates. For the final week, I had an introduction to Umbraco, the
CMS( content management system) tool that was used to build the AIPA website, and used it to
create a simple website with features similar to the AIPA website. During the whole duration
with the AIPA team, I attended different agile scrum meetings. I had sessions with Eng. Doaa
where she explained agile practices in Link development and the role of the project manager
from the project bidding process till the project delivery.
Backend development relied on concepts studied in two major courses in my curriculum:
CSEN501- DataBases I and CSEN701- Advanced Computer lab. This internship has changed
my perspective on web development in general and backend development specifically. It showed
me how a project is modeled on a professional scale and the collaboration between different
specializations in the team. It also emphasized the importance of writing clean code and
following strict frameworks and design patterns, which actually facilitates development in the
long term. Moreover, It showed a very clear example of a healthy company environment, where
project leaders help and respect all the team members, which was represented by the continuous
mentoring and support from both Eng. Ahmed and Eng.Doaa. Based on my experience, I fully
recommend interning at Link Development for other students and I intend to return as a full-time
engineer.
In conclusion, the Internship was a great experience in working on a web development project, a
great practice on agile, and an outstanding personal experience in dealing with work supervisors.
I had strong revision on previous backend development knowledge and a good grasp of new
technologies like .NET core, and design patterns like Repository, and showed project flow
between different phases and departments. I am looking forward to returning again to Link
development for full-time offers. The company is currently working on various exciting projects
that support the government's digital transition like the “Digital Courts” project, which appears
to be a great career opportunity.
