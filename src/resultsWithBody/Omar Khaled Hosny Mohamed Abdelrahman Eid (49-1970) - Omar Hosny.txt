In my report I am \ngoing to describe the company and I am going to talk about the tasks I performed and the programs I used as \nwell as the skills I have learnt from the internship. I will also talk about what I expected and what I found and \nhow the internship could influence my future plans and how the internship tasks related to what I have learnt in \nmy studies.  \n  \n  \nI will start with describing the company, it is an Egyptian startup company, and their main objective is \nproviding a high integrity gas /oil Engineering and installation services to the Petroleum industry. Their main \nobjective is not really related to my field, but no company in the world these days can survive without an IT \ndepartment as everyone works now on network using technology devices so if any problem happens all the \nwork stops that is why you need IT. It is the it job to solve any problem that can delay the work and always put \na plan for the worst case scenarios. \n  \n  \nI am going to talk now about the tasks I did during the internship, I was taught how it is important to always \nkeep a back-up of data  as if anything corrupts you don\xe2\x80\x99t lose files that you have been working on for a lot of \ntime. I also learnt how to use virtual machines where I can use an operating system like Linux or Ubuntu on a \npc that runs windows. I learnt as well how does companies use network within the company and how do they \ncommunicate when they have a working place in the desert for example. \n  \n  \n  \nMoreover, I am going to evaluate my internship. I will start with that I am very satisfied and happy with this \nexperience and I would recommend it to any one that wants to learn more practically about software, the \ncompany employees are very friendly and helpful and I learnt a lot of skills from this experience like how to \nwork with other people and how to multi task and I learnt how to deal with stress handling which I am not very \ngood with. The internship definitely exceeded my expectations as I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to learn that much in a short \nperiod of time. This internship would influence my future plans where I would concentrate on the working \nenvironment before thinking about working in any company. I always couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see what is the use of what I am \nlearning in my studies and how would I use it I working life, but I was pretty happy in this internship as I \nrelated to a lot of my studies like the data bases course that related a lot to what I did in the internship.  \n  \n  \nIn conclusion, I am very satisfied with my internship and I would recommend it to any friend and if I had an \nopportunity in the future to go back there, I will definitely do. I noticed as well that it is very important to \nchoose a good working environment to work in as it helps you to be more efficient. I will talk more on my \ndepartment now which is the IT department which is a pretty important department as it ensures that the system \nkeeps on working and solve any problems any employee face and work on solving any problem as fast as \npossible as not to delay any work. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0c   \n \n   \n6 \nStudent Career & Alumni Development Office. scad@guc.edu.eg | German University in Cairo New Cairo City - Main Entrance Al Tagamoa Al Khames; Egypt \n \n \n \n'
